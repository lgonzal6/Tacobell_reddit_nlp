So I stumbled upon this sub, and after scrolling I found out that many users here have claimed that Burritos and Nachos aren't Mexican food.

Guys, understand that Mexican food is heavily regional, Nachos were created in Piedras Negras and are a staple dish all over Northern Mexico. Burritos are literally a state dish in Sonora and Chihuahua and also a staple dish all over Northern Mexico.

Much of Tex-Mex gastronomy was imported from Northern Mexico, but that doesn't make Northern Mexican gastronomy any less ""authentic""

The worst offenders on this issue are mainly Mexican-Americans who believe that Burritos, Nachos and other Mexican dishes don't exist in Mexico because their family who comes from Central or Southern Mexico told them so. 

Even more extremist purists on Mexican food have gone as far as saying things such as:

""Flour tortillas are not a thing in Mexico""

Meats:
Carnitas (shoulder + skin)
Carne asada al carbon
Pollo asado estilo sinaloa (I know chicken tacos aren’t very popular, but this is good, cheap, and easy-to-make. Not everyone in the group eats red meat.)

Tortillas: flour and corn (I’ve found incredible fresh flour tortillas, still looking for good corn. Making by hand is not an option for this.)

Salsas:
Fresh avocado salsa (not spicy)
Chiltomate (will make spicy)

Sides/garnishes:
Chiles toreados
Nopalitos asados
Cebollitas asadas
Sliced cucumbers
Sliced radishes
Pickled red onions + habaneros
White onions / cilantro
Limes
Pickled carrots (worth making fresh? or canned?)
Potatoes (roasted? recommendations?)

I’m not currently planning to have beans/rice - we’ll all be drinking a lot, and these will be too heavy/filling. I also have no practice making beans and don’t want to make something subpar.

Add 450ml of milk, 2.5 more cups of water, 10 grams of condensed milk, 2 tablespoons of vanilla essence, and lastly sugar and cinnamon sugar until it’s just the right sweetness.

I *think* they cracked because of their thickness, but here's what I did:

made the masa, let it hydrate for around 30 minutes, and then pressed into taco-sized tortillas from about a ping-pong/golf ball sized ball.

Then I used a really hot stainless steel pan to cook them, probably abot 2 mins on the first side and 1 minute on the second.  Enough to get a char on both sides.

Then they all went in a teatowel to steam together.  The ones at the bottom were probably in there for about 15 minutes.

At this point, I'll just say, we ended up having tacos, and the tortillas were delicious and perfectly pliable when we ate them about 10 minutes later.  I'd be happy with them normally.

but I proceded to heat some oil in a pan, and following the advice on a video, I pre-dipped the tortillas in the oil for about 3-5 seconds.  One got stuck and cooked for like 10 seconds and that one felt crispy coming out.

Then, while the tortilla was still hot, I tried to roll the first taquito and although it stayed together, it cracked pretty badly in three places.  It was what I was afraid of, but I used every trick I know to make them as pliable as possible.  If it is the thickness, that's more or less down to my press, plus the fact that they tend to break as I peel them off the plastic insert I use if they get too much thinner.

Hey there!

I am trying to cook a meal from every country every month for a few years (16,3 to be precise). Now I am trying to get started with Mexican food, since I never really ate anything mexican.

I thought I try to get started with Burritos and Tacos, since these are the only things I ever tasted.  
Has anyone some good, typical recipe for it and would like to share it with me? Id like to try to do them as ""original"" (I know everyone may have their own style, but where I am from you just get this touristic food, which I don't think is the normal way to do it, but the way the most tourists like it...) as possible.

If anyone has some other suggestions what to cook (I am not very familiar with the mexican cuisine), I am open minded for everything new.

Kind regards,

There were no chopped greens or anything floating in the juice, the juice was totally liquid. No oil either, the juice was totally water based.

There were however large pieces of onion and full pieces (with stems in tact) of what seemed like cilantro, but I could be wrong.

But, from my understanding, a classic fish taco in baja would usually be: 

fried fish (sometimes batter includes mustard for color)
shredded green cabbage
crema (sometimes crema/mayo)
hot sauce or salsa (ex: salsa de arbol)
optional: pickled onions w/ oregano or salsa mexicana
served w/ lime

A local place that specializes in Oaxacan cuisine and is extremely authentic from what I understand (and the research I have done) serves their fish tacos like this:

fried fish
pickled red cabbage
avocado salsa (sauce-like gaucamole)
mango habanero salsa
cilantro
served w/ lime


After all of that, my question is: is this a common fish taco found in parts of Oaxaca? Mazunte is a beach town in Oaxaca so I'm wondering if it's found in this area, or if it's even more widespread? Or if it's also served like this in other parts of Mexico?

I have tried freezing chopped cilantro, and that might work for cilantro to be cooked with but its not appetizing as a taco topper.

I have kept chopped cilantro with chopped onions in a container.  This seems to work the best.  I am not sure, maybe the onion is helping preserve the cilantro.  More than a week later yeah its not the freshest but the onions and cilantro taste good.

If I chop up cilantro and put it in a container by itself, it goes to crap in 2-3 days.  However I'm not sure its the lack of onion causing the problem, or the cilantro source.  Because when I kept both onion and cilantro in the same container it was cilantro I grew myself, so probably fresher than what I have from the store.  Also some stores treat their cilantro differently, and that could have an affect.

Anyhow, I hate wasting food especially a condiment which I could simply not buy.

He was born here but his parents raised him in Mexico, and he came here some years ago to study. My wife and I have always enjoyed his company. We have a lot of faith in him and we treat him as our own child.

For his birthday, we offered to take him wherever he liked and he said he wanted a nice Mexican restaurant. Living in the Bay Area, Mexican “style” was the best we could do and honestly we should’ve just gone to a taco truck.

This place was an attack on the concept of Mexican food. My wife and I both ordered some frankly mediocre mole flautas, and he ordered a Surf &amp; Turf Molcajete.

Now, Molcajetes are something which I’ve had more than once living in Mexico but apparently the cook at this establishment never has because this particular dish was a fucking abomination.

It was soupy but this was the least of its problems.

The meat was tough and stringy, they put half a wheel of panela cheese along with a whole leaf of nopal, and a link of chorizo.

If all that wasn’t enough, this thing had overcooked shrimp on it but it was mostly beans. BEANS. And not refried beans but partly cooked, undersalted whole-ass pinto beans.

He barely touched it and I felt so bad about it all that I told him on his next birthday I’ll cook him a real Molcajete.

Well, it’s not his birthday yet. It’s mine. This weekend is my birthday and I want to take advantage of the fact that we’ll fire up the grill to make him a badass dish.

The problem is that all of the recipes I’ve found so far seem to be not what I’ve had in the states.

Ingredients 

2 poblano peppers 

1 jalapeño pepper

Some onion, and garlic (I eyeball what looks like enough) 

1 cup of vegetable broth

Cilantro to taste


Method

Char the raw veggies except the cilantro

Add charred vegetables to a pot with a cup of vegetable broth. Heat to a simmer to soften.

I make a number of good dishes  at home, but nothing beats food from a good Mexican restaurant.  There are few things I can’t seem to get right at home.  Most notably, I can’t nail enchilada sauce.  For a guy who orders half a gallon of enchilada sauce every time he goes to his families favorite Mexican restaurant, this is a problem.

I would estimate that I have attempted making this sauce at least 30-40 times at home.  I’ve made a few batches that I felt were close to the sauce I get at the restaurant, but tasting them side-by-side, I can easily taste the difference. 

I don’t think there is anything special about the sauce I get at the restaurant.  I’ve had enchilada sauce at many restaurants that is just as good, if not better. I go to the one I go to because it is the most convenient.

I’m convinced that using the right chili is the most important part of the sauce.  It almost has to be.

It should be noted that this will be the first time I try a broth meal, and also first time I'm braising my meat instead of grilling or pan frying.

Any beginner tips? 

What sort of meat should I use? I am following Joshua Weissmans recipe and he calls for 3.0 pounds of meat (ca 1.6 kg), which frsnkly, I can't afford, and I will only make this for me and a friend. If I change the amount of meat to 900 g (a bit under 2 lb) but keep everything else the same, will my meal be ruined? I care deeply about this friend and I decidedly to don this challenge because he recently broke up with his gf, so i want this to be as good as it can be. The only place i know of locally that sells fresh beef has chuck steak, but I don't know where to find oxtail or short ribs. Any alternatives, that are also cheap? 

And the beef stock. Weissman insisted on homemade stock, but as of now, because of money and convenience, I got three buljong dice instead. is this acceptable, or will the taste be dramatically weakened like this?

Finally, the tortilla and cheese. It is impossible for me where I live to get Oaxaca cheese, which is the og cheese I should use. Will fresh mozzarella do? And the tortilla, I can get both flour and corn, i think, but will there be a noticeable difference in either?

Want to start a tamale food truck and would like some advice. In my area the health department doesn’t allow any real cooking in the truck- essentially it’s all heat n serve. 
My plan was to rent commercial kitchen space where a thousand tamales could be made and steamed for half an hour. . cooled and bagged up and refrigerated. I would then finish steaming for a half hour in the truck. . Seems things are not so simple. 

HERE is where I need advice- my vision of things was to have pots of 50 simmering on the stove so it would be a quick high volume serve. 
I posted on a Facebook site asking fo advice and it was all over the place( over cooked, use foil etc)
Would appreciate ppls advice eg. 
fully steam them at the commercial kitchen, wrap them in foil and then find a good way to reheat in the truck. . SO I CAN HAVE HUNDREDs READY to sell in a fast paced lunch environment. . fresh and hot- not over cooked or dried out.

2. I just made my first batch of masa, but it turned out to be the bleached white looking kind of corn tortilla, the bland flavorless ones without the sweetness of corn, or the yellow color. What do I need to purchase next time, to get those decadent yellow, sweet-corn flavored tortillas?
3. Is it can I get away with making a big bag of masa so that I can just press and cook tortillas throughout the week, without all the headache of mixing, kneading, and making a mess?

I realize the ones from Victoria are usually much cheaper, though they have been sold out at normal prices for the vast majority if this year, with people trying to sell them for $50.

They had a delicious salsa verde (we think that’s what it was) that would come out as an entree/starter.

They had a green salsa and a red one.  The green one was heavenly, and I would be ecstatic if I was able to replicate it.

It’s hard to describe what it tasted like, it was fairly thin, and a spoonful of it tasted something like a beautiful Italian salad condensed into a teaspoon.

His dad was supposed to teach me how to make red chile this year, but he passed away very suddenly in October and never got the chance. I asked a few friends and people in my neighborhood if anyone had a recipe for red chile so I could make some for my fiance, and someone shared their grandma's recipe which is super simple:

5 dried chile guajillos, 4 dried chile puyo, 2 dried chile pasillo ancho, 1/4 white onion, 2 tbsp minced garlic, 2 tbsp beef boullion, and 2 tbsp salt. They say to blend the peppers in 2 cups of hot water, cube the pork, brown the pork, and then simmer in the sauce for 20 minutes.

My fiance said something similar but said that some of his family just buy a bag of ""red chile peppers"" and use those, rather than using different types of peppers (nobody knows what his dad did, though). Additionally, his dad would sometimes sear the meat and then cook it in the sauce in a slow cooker for the rest of the day, so I have no clue whether I should just brown it or if I should put it in the slow cooker as some people do it differently. Also, if I do go based off of the recipe and use the different types of peppers, how spicey or not might this recipe turn out? His dads always turned out very flavorful and savory but not really spicey by any means.

Thank you so much for any insight you can offer.

No intiendo español muy bien, entonses favor de escribe en inglés.

today, I went to a local Mexican restaurant called Taqueria el Manhattan. That might sound like something having your alarm bells going off saying, Texmex, not authentic! Sorry! I am here to tell you however, if you bring up their menu online, this is the location in Fort Mill SC. you would not believe their menu! Probably the most authentic place I have ever been, and that's saying something.

I decided to be very brave. Yes. I do know what is in this dish, so don't worry about thinking ""If he only knew what he just ate. "" i'm pretty much aware. anyway, my brother and I both for the very first time ever got to try very authentically mend Menudo. The way they prepared it was with the red colored broth. The lady who served us is from Ecuador. She said that they are, the way they make it is with a white colored broth. The way we had it today included onions, cilantro, jalapeños, although I left those out, and I think it also had potatoes. I get confused of the one other main ingredient which unfortunately grosses a lot of people out. Is it cal stomach… aka tribe? I was under the impression that it was actually Cal intestines. can somebody up here familiar with the dish please clarify?

my brother and I have both been blind since birth, therefore, visually, we were unable to see exactly what this was, and only could go by feel and taste, however, there was something down deep inside the bowl which was very very hard as a rock. Some sort of a bone. Definitely not something you would like to try biting into. He would break your teeth did so. it had meat around the bone however. It kind of reminded me of the way a prime rib would look. I don't know if that was intestines? Or what that was exactly. either way though, the meat was absolutely delicious!

i'm curious if anyone else up here has ever had this soup before, and if so, what you all thought of it. Also, if somebody could describe to me the couple of things I am a bit confused on, that would be very appreciated. please write your responses to me in English.

I am trying to find the absolute best recipe for flour tortillas for use making burritos.

I know this means they have to be really fatty and chewy, not as flaky and thick as standalone flour tortillas.

  
What I don't know is how you achieve this!  


I've scoured YouTube and reddit for flour tortilla tutorials, but I would like to get your comprehensive tips/recipes/anything you guys have that can help me.  


(I am also interested in anything unique - if you guys know how to make a really chewy corn tortilla that I could use to wrap a burrito, that would also be cool!)

So I need the little details to get a soft tender tortilla please.
Here are some questions:

1. How do I know how well my tortillas are hydrated? I assuming they need to have sufficient water content to puff up maybe mine are a little dry to start?

2. How thin is too thin? I want them to be decent size, not to small but I believe when I did that the second time I rolled them to thin. Is there a trick to tell how thin or thick they should be? 

3. How hot should I have my cast iron when cooking them? Should it be scorching hot? Like hot hot?

4. My last question is about preparing them in advance. Am I able to roll them out before hand place on parchment and stack, place in a ziplock and put in the fridge without them drying out for a day? And cook them the next day?

At some Mexican restaurants they have chicken tacos made with shredded chicken.

The onions and peppers are clearly visible (maybe 1 inch long). The chicken has a slight orange/red tint, possibly from tomatoes but it could be from something else. It is also extremely wet and always drips out of the taco when eating it and leaves the tortilla soggy. The taste doesn't suggest that it has a lot of the traditional Mexican spices (cumin, etc.) but it might contain some. 

I kind of wonder if it's a pre-made mixture the restaurants are buying, perhaps in a can or frozen. If so, I'd love to know the brand or where I can buy it.

This is how I cook carnitas and they come out juicy (3.5 hours at 275 degrees- I don't add lard, just a little olive oil and the fat from the pork works fine to render it). If it's the same cut of meat (pork shoulder), I'm not sure why it's necessary to wrap the meat directly. Am I missing something crucial?

Any advice would be appreciated.",True,False,False,mexicanfood,t5_2ry0l,20219.0,public,self,How to cook cochinita pibil?,0.0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mexicanfood/comments/i3xiwy/how_to_cook_cochinita_pibil/,all_ads,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I’m an Italian who only knows how to make Italian food unfortunately and proficiently seasons and dabbles with Chinese and Thai food somehow lol. 

My boyfriend of 10 years (needless to say we are pretty candid and blunt with one another) is Mexican and Peruvian. He is also a picky eater &amp; severely lactose intolerant which pretty much ruins most Italian dishes because I’m usually just in it for the cheese lol. 

We are always in a hurry so we really rely on quick meals, a rice cooker, &amp; a crockpot. 

I make the worst “Mexican” food pretty much in the world. Mexican and Peruvian food is pretty much all he likes to make matters worse. 
Most of our meals are simple and just consist of seasoned meat and white rice. 
Every time I try to add what I think is some sort of Mexican or peruvian “flare” it pretty much comes out horrible and he hates it, anddddddd so do I but I’ll never admit it to him I just keep telling him he’s picky🤣

Most recipes on the internet are usually for a full complete dish which we usually don’t do- just some seasoned meat and bland rice. My seasoning is so bad at this point if it’s not Italian, where he pleads me to just do salt and pepper on everything only. Which makes me sad and my taste buds sad. 

I’m going to be the mom where everyone was giving my dinner to the dog which also makes me sad because I thought I was a great cook. 

I guess what I’m getting at are, what are (if there is any) just some standard spice combinations? 

If I want to make rice in the rice cooker- what spices can I make that would add some flare. What are some basic spice measurements / spices to add to meat? 
Any idea how to make a Mexican pica-dillo not the Cuban kind? 

He doesn’t have a mom, but his grandma raised him and used to make the best food. Unfortunately I was an idiot and never asked her how she made things and now she’s pretttty old after 10 years and her food isn’t really the same, it’s not what it was and she won’t admit it but I think she’s started to forget what she uses to cook. I know my boyfriend misses that and how she cooks, which she doesn’t do anymore and I’m unable to even come close to getting anything she used to make right or even anything Mexican or peruvian tasting at all. Everyone loves their moms cooking so it’s understandable, I just want to figure out how I can be half as good as her cooking and really just have some tasty simple food.

I bought my ""Aztec blender"" a few weeks ago, and have spent the last couple weeks grinding rice and rinsing at least once a day. I got to the point where I couldn't see any more bits of grit in the ground rice mix, and happily set to making salsa and guacamole with pretty decent results.

Today I'm making guacamole and maybe I was rougher than before, but it's full of tiny little dots of grit again! So I have two questions, if you'll indulge me.

1. If the grit simply never goes away, am I looking at an inferior product? I've done a lot of reading, but some people seem to say it's normal, while others say it's a sign of poor quality.

2. If I continue to get the odd fleck of grit in my guac or salsa once in a while, is it a problem for my teeth? I mean, I'd rather not feed my wife bits of rock, but I'm OK with eating stuff with the occasional speck, as long as it's not actually slowly grinding my teeth down...

(Yes, I should keep trying to season the thing, but honestly I got to the point where I couldn't see any evidence of grit. So if I started again, I wouldn't know when to stop...)

However now that I'm a little more experienced with Mexican cooking, I recognize that most of those super complicated recipes only have a ton of ingredients because they're essentially having you make achiote paste from scratch, and the Mexican markets in my area have enough variety of ingredients now that I can easily get achiote paste, bottled Goya sour orange juice, and frozen banana leaves.

My biggest question is about the orange juice. I know for other citrus like lime and lemon the bottled version is a pale imitation of fresh juice, so would I be better off using fresh sweet orange juice and a substitute souring agent like lime juice or vinegar instead of the bottled sour orange juice?

Also I was curious about using a pressure cooker. Obviously the traditional way is to have a whole suckling pig wrapped in leaves and buried in a piib, but most recipes have you wrap pork shoulder or leg in the leaves and slow roast to steam the meat. I've had great luck in the past with slow braised dishes in the pressure cooker, and since it's a sealed you don't lose much of the juices and drippings, which I understand to be a pretty major flavor component of the finished meat. Could I just wrap the marinated pork in banana leaves then cook it under pressure?

I have been searching/scouring the internet for years to find a dupe of my favorite restaurant salsa ever. I have tried ""restaurant"" style salsa recipes and they are good but don't look like or taste like the one I am hunting. The restaurant that made it went out of business years ago. (I even asked the owner if he would tell me the recipe but alas he would not.)

The restaurant was Gina's in Bryan, Texas. But I have been to other Mexican and Tex-Mex places that had a similar salsa.

I am currently in Scotland on lockdown and there is no Mexican food happening in my life save for what I can make myself. 

I have tried every combination of keywords I can think of to find the right recipe but have had zero success. So I come to you, begging for your assistance.

Here's what I can tell you:

1) It was a very thin, almost watery, transparent/translucent salsa that they brought to the table in squeeze bottles and syrup bottles (the kind with the little slider on top) so you could fill up the salsa bowl yourself or pour over your food. 2) It was not bright red. It was more pale red-pale orange in color. 3) Zero chunks of anything. The most texture you could discern were some seeds (tomato? peppers? idk) and some slivers of skin (tomatoes? peppers? idk). 4) I don't believe it was roasted because there were no blackened pieces in it. But I don't *think* it was a raw salsa. It might have been cooked but I don't remember it having a sheen like oil was in it. But I just don't know. 5) It varied in heat from one visit to the next. Maybe jalapeno to serrano on the Scoville scale? 6) They served it cold. 7) It did not taste of cumin. 8) It did not have cilantro in it.

The closest I have come to it is a salsa roja that mentioned the squeeze bottles in their description and looks sort of similar but is chunkier and thicker than what I am hunting.

I have cross-posted over at SalsaSnobs and so far I can rule out a chile Arbol orange sauce (way too thick and is bright orange), salsa macha, and sriracha. 

One person said that they had an uncle who had worked at a restaurant in Texas and that they had a thin translucent salsa and it may have been made with tomatillos and chicken stock as part of the ingredients. 

Does this ring any bells with anyone? 

I would be so grateful if anyone has any ideas.

Many thanks.

So, I had my first attempt at making masa at home last night. Let the corn sit in lime overnight and rinsed and prepped this morning. I have a Victoria corn mill that I ran the nixtamal through, but even when tightened as far as I could, the masa was very grainy. Maybe ok for tamales, but not great for tortillas. 

So, I put the masa in my food processor and blended it with water to make it a hummus-like consistency before adding regular Maseca back into the mix to thicken it up and dry it back out. 

The process worked, but was a) a pain in the ass and b) the goal of  making my own masa was to get away from Maseca and use really good corn (Masienda). 

So, my question is: outside of putting in a lot of muscle to grind it with a matete or spending a small fortune getting a Nixtamatic to the States (plus, I don't have that kind of kitchen space.

But, the sad truth is that very few Mexican restaurants can compare to what you experience in Mexico or your native mother's home cooking.

Even in Mexico, some of the big tourist areas have begun to conform to the tourist palate by cooking things the TexMex way. 

You can taste the difference in quality: mass produced tortillas versus handmade, canned beans versus home cooked beans, mexican rice with tomato paste instead of making the tomato sauce from scratch, salsas with no heat and fistfuls of cumin. Americans love to put cumin in everything thinking it makes it more Mexican because they don't know about epazote, achiote, and oregano. Don't even get me started on the mountains of cheddar cheese and sour cream!

I think it's great to have an appreciation for the food and the culture, but there also has to be some respect for it's traditional roots. There are Mexican dishes from the prehispanic era that are a thousand years old, and the Viceroyalty and 19th century where we see European influences from Spain and France. These traditional dishes are NOT the American plates people call TexMex.

There's a history of mestizaje in the food and a history of our indigenous roots that deserves to be BOLD and unapologetic to the foreign palate. Some people won't like the sourness of lime used in ceviche or aguachiles, or the spicy drenching heat from tortas ahogadas, or the sweet nutty earthiness of mole poblano, or the fat butteriness of menudo. That's okay! Don't change the dish to please foreign taste and call it Mexican. 

If you live in America or you make food for American tourists at resorts that is not authentic, just call it American food. 

Mexican food needs to stay vibrant and intense, and your taco bell menu doesn't deserve to be called Mexican food.

Carma asada is great but grilling out door is tough in the winter. I know you can grill in the oven but I was curious to hear your preferred method 

I use to put meat on baking sheet and cook on broil but that method creates a mess and the oven will eventually cook the juice and leave a smoky mess in your house. 

Instead, I now  put meat on top of BBQ grill and then put grill over one of those turkey aluminum tins. This helps separate juice from meat. I then set oven to broil and cook for 5 minutes. You have to make sure to monitor meat or else it will burn and juice will burn and create smoke as well. Still a Bette method then putting meet on cooking baking sheet.

I hope this is the appropriate place to ask this question and find some help. I go to Mexican restaurants fairly often with work, family and friends but have always struggle with what to order. The closest thing that I know I like is tacos using taco seasoning old (brands like old El Paso and such). I don’t tend to add anything I just like hard shell tacos and the ground beef with the seasoning cooked into it.

So when I go to order tacos at a restaurant my first thought is to order hard tacos with only ground beef. Of course I found these bland because nothing is giving them flavor. After some experimenting I still have yet to find something I like. Would anyone have any idea on what I should order along to try to replicate this flavor or somewhat?

I’m an anthropologist who tries dearly to make sure that cultures and traditions are not white-washed for the sake of capital... among other things.

Would this restaurant crater by a white make diminish or elevate Mexican cuisine? He has no ties to the culture or cuisine. He says he’ll read books and visit Mexico City one day, but, otherwise, when confronted, he replies, “I don’t care. I’ll do what I want.” I’m also a white lady with no Latin heritage.

The typical American taco with ground beef (and by typical I mean the average white family cooking ground beef for taco night) is prepared as such: ground beef browned in a pan, fat drained out, a seasoning packet dumped on top and mixed in, and then water added and reduced until ready to serve.  

What this typically yields is a greasy mess that is strong on the cumin and salt. The ground beef is usually broken up only so much in the pan so the pieces are larger. If this meat sits at room temperature it usually congeals to beef covered in orange gel.  

In contrast, whenever I’ve ordered a ground beef taco at Mexican restaurants, the beef is finely ground and well-seasoned, and always better than what my family made growing up.

Some of us in the United States can be considered the lucky ones. Depending on where you live you get access to a wide variety of taquerias with fantastic recipes, long legacies, and great quality control.

Other areas? Not always so much. I've been lucky to have spent most of my life in West Coast states where this is largely true, but the further North you go, the spottier things seem to get.

I imagine it's a function of supply and distribution, how only a couple hundred miles can change a lot.

But one observation I've made over time is that, with the exception of Southern California, the price of food at places which grill their chicken is higher than places which shred their chicken. 

I've seen fewer exceptions to this rule the further North I go.

Generally the grilled chicken is deliciously tender, never dry, well- seasoned with even a nice char that goes great with any smoky hot sauce. It is missing noticeable connective tissue and fat, and the impression I get is that the meat was probably expensive.

Contrasting this with shredded chicken, and often it seems there is...well...less flavor in shredded chicken. Depending on how it was cooked, the sauce is either quite mild, with a noticeably plain base chicken taste, or the sauce is very flavorful, but the chicken meat itself doesn't present flavor wise.

I suspect, and anyone who knows better than me can confirm, is it easier to hide ""cheap"" chicken by shredding it and slow cooking? 

I'm using inductive reasoning here, because at the same restaurants which shred their chicken, I'm far more likely to get a gristly Asada. Places which grill their chicken tend to also have tender, not gristly Asada.

So by now, when I see shredded chicken on the menu, I tend to suspect how much the meat actually cost.

I'm almost certain this isn't always true, and suspect also it may not be widely true, but for those in the know, why would a chef decide to use a grilled chicken vs. a shredded chicken recipe? Is it regional where the former is preferred to the latter? Or is it indeed a way to make cheaper chicken taste more appetizing?

Perhaps some of both?  Does anybody have a compelling story of why they prefer shredded chicken to a tender grilled chicken?

she usually blends or uses a molcajete 
she first puts a little water and salt as a base
she roasts tomatoes and Serrano peppers in a pan until they have black spots
THEN ! here is where i get lost... 
does she blend it all together? and add other things? I don’t know. usually the consistency is very watery and thin and i like it!! I like it very spicy too :( Im hoping someone else kinda makes it like this and can give me all the steps.. thank you!

So, a couple of questions - 1) is there another cooking process I could use to get the same results and 2) what are some variations for this from different areas of Mexico outside of Puebla.

Recipe:

Serves 6-8
Ingredients
4 oz. tomatillos, husked and rinsed
2 jalapeños, stemmed
2 cups lightly packed cilantro leaves
1 tsp. sugar
4 whole cloves garlic, peeled, plus 6 cloves, roughly chopped
2 lb. baby back pork ribs, cut into individual ribs
1 tsp. dried oregano
1 large white onion, cut lengthwise into 8 wedges
1 medium zucchini, cut into 2"" x 12"" batons
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
Warm tortillas, for serving

Instructions

Place tomatillos and jalapeños in a 4-qt. saucepan, and cover with water by 1"". Bring to a boil over high heat; cook until slightly soft, about 5 minutes. Drain vegetables, and set aside to cool to room temperature. Place in a food processor along with cilantro, sugar, and whole garlic, and pulse until finely chopped but not puréed; set sauce aside.

Bring pork and 4 cups water to a boil in a 6-qt. saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until all water evaporates, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Continue cooking pork, stirring often, until it begins to caramelize on the outside, about 10 minutes. Add chopped garlic, oregano, and onion, and cook, stirring, until soft and lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Add sauce, and fry, stirring constantly, until slightly reduced, about 5 minutes. Add 4 cups water, bring to a boil, and then reduce heat to medium-low; cook, stirring occasionally, until pork is tender and sauce is thickened, about 30 minutes. Add zucchini, and cook until warmed through, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

Divide pork and sauce among serving bowls and garnish with a drizzling of salsa, if you like.

Surely a lot of people in the southern US states knows the difference, but most US people (including a lot  of people with Mexican roots) do consider Taco bell ""Mexican"".

**You can create Mexican food outside of Mexico** - To put it simply, you simply can't. You can however create fussion dishes based on traditional Mexican recipes (and call those whatever you like, like dim sum tacos or Minessota tamales) but everything you create outside the country is something else but Mexican. Most Mexicans in actual Mexico agree on this. 

**Cheddar Cheese is used in Mexican Food** - It's not. The Yucatan peninsula is certainly fond of Yellow Dutch Cheese and use it in several dishes, but you never use cheddar in Mexican recipes, ever. 

**All Mexican food has 'chile' on it** - Plenty of dishes can be eaten and prepared without chiles and even when most Mexicans like some spicy capsaiscin, it's not mandatory, plenty of Mexicans eat no chile at all.

**Doritos were invented in Disneyland** - Technically they were not, despite what stories that company's marketing team created to appeal US chauvinism, flavored tortilla chips have been in any Mexican Kitchen for thousands of years. Pretending that frito lay created something (instead of just adding a particular flavor) is like saying that Pizza was invented in Chicago by some cook that had tomato sauce and cheese around.

Here's what I know, empirically and from research:



- Blue corn has more protein than the typical yellow/white varieties we use in the states
- Because it has more protein (I think this is the reason), it is a little more difficult to work with than yellow/white corn flours.
- Because of this, I've found the most success using a little bit of AP flour in the recipe (blue corn maseca + ap flour + baking soda +hot water)
- I've seen a few recipes that don't use AP flour, but they do add a little bit of fat (oil/lard). I'm assuming they do this because, like adding fat to flour tortillas, the blue corn's high protein means it needs the help of fat to come together better as a dough.



Can anyone comment on any of this? I'd like to make blue corn tortillas without the addition of a wheat flour - I'm going to make them tonight with no wheat flour, but with some fat.

Anyway, I digress. All I can really tell is that they use at least a little bit of butter in the mashed potatoes.

I've been trying to find a recipe for the proper ratio of spices to liquid to form the paste but have only found one link (which recommends 3 parts spices to 1 part liquid). 

Does anyone know what the best ratio is? Also, for liquid should it just be water/broth or should there be any oil, etc.?

Since I grew up in New Mexico, my visit turned into a quest for great Mexican food. (east coaster) I'm going to not name the restaurants that weren't up to par, but I'm going to share two stories (one good and one bad) and then use that as a pretext to ask a culinary question of you my fellow Mexicans.  

First, the bad news. My family went out to this restaurant and my bro and I ordered Carnitas. They come out pretty quickly and they looked promising--clearly roasted, plenty of marbling and I'm excited. Then I take the first bite and it is warm but chewy. As I chew, my eyebrows start to go up.  As an optimist, I filter out negative feelings routinely and tell myself to grab a tortilla, some green sauce and try again, maybe with some refried beans mixed in. All of that tasted ok except for the carnitas. My brother asks me what I thought of the Carnitas and I think I summarized it  as succinctly as possible:  ""I think we're eating leftovers.""  Dude. I'm serious, it tasted like they made the carnitas the day before, stored them in the fridge and then threw them into the oven before serving them. Dried, chewy and that chemically taste that you only get the second day after you try to eat meat.   You know what I'm talking about.  Meat undergoes some sort of transformation when it is refrigerated and heated up again.  As we all know, the only use for used meat is soup. You can't double cook any meat. Ok, I  admit, yes, fried rice can also be a venue for day old meat.  But dude, you don't cook carnitas, refrigerate them and then serve them again, in a restaurant!  ¡híjole!  

Some of you are wondering what I did in response. Did I send it back?  Nope. I have a rule against that since it is pretty rude and even if someone disrespects me enough to serve old Carnitas, I do not get dragged down.  In this case, I just ate what was decent and had an extra beer or two--the chips were decent. However, in other cases, I have resorted to ordering a second entre. This usually results in the wait staff asking if everything is ok.  Yes, I say, no problem, I'm just going to sample something else.  (sometimes they take it off the check but I would never ask...never).  

Now the good news. I often search out great breakfast burritos and was told to try Burrito Tower.  I'm not affiliated with them in any way.  This place knocked it out of the park. First, it is a total hole in the wall. It is literally a former gas station. The inside has only 4 tables.  I told my brothers they should have called it Burrito Station or Burrito Service Station. They laughed a little and I said, ""Exxon Burrito"" and yes, that joke brought real laughter ...deservedly so. 

Anyway, the food was spectacular.  First, the tortillas were really fresh and that's the first thing you taste so I just don't understand anyone anywhere trying to sell Mexican food without thinking long and hard about how to offer a tasty tortilla (corn or flour).  The eggs, sausage, cheese and potatoes were awesome. They had lots of other combinations including beans, chiles, etc. The potatoes were perfect. They werent overcooked but were soft and buttered. Friggin amazing.  We ended up eating there every day.   We being my family. 

One day, there was a lot of errand running around and I snuck back over to Burrito Tower for lunch because I haven't had a good beef/bean burrito since I was a kid.  I didn't tell any of my family because we all knew having been eating there every morning was starting to attract attention. So I stealthily showed up again at the drive through window.  I was not disappointed. In fact, I couldn't believe how good the ground beef was in the burrito.  I later revealed my secret mission to my family and got some laughs because, yeah, I'm a freak. 

That brings me to my question. How the heck did they get the beef to taste so good?  Before you mention Cumin, let me say that I'm not a fan of it. Or at least, let me say that Chipotle is very over reliant on this spice.    What I'm wondering is if maybe people cook ground beef in bacon grease or something. Anyway, I'm looking for any tips you have to make really good beef for a burrito.
