Agroth16,"So I used to work at a Taco Bell on my campus for three years. I usually closed since that was when you'd be able to take a good haul home (unofficially of course). The Cheesy Gordita Crunch and the Crunchwrap are my two favorite items at TB. One night I decided to combine the two together and it became my go-to item. Basically, after you add the meat and cheese of the crunchwrap, instead of just adding a tostada you add a flatbread with three cheese (steam it first). Then you add the tostada, an extra scoop of beef, and the rest is like making a regular crunchwrap. It honestly tastes so good and I wish I could get it at a regular taco bell, I just don't think the price is worth it (also explaining it every time).

memetortoise6969,"So I have a problem. There are two Taco Bell‚Äòs near where I live, and every time that I go to either of them, the food takes forever to make and the staff are rude.

This isn‚Äôt me being a Karen, I worked at a Taco Bell for a year and my Taco Bell was always busy and I would always be doing so much work to the best of my ability. So I know what busy is and I know how quickly and professionally this job can be done. Whenever I go inside I always see the workers taking forever to make the food, like they‚Äôre going slowly like there‚Äôs not a care in the world, and no one ever seems to want to help me or has ever said to me ‚Äúhold on I‚Äôll be with you in a moment.‚Äù They always ignore me until I say something. I‚Äôm also an Uber eats delivery driver and I try not to go there anymore because I can‚Äôt be waiting for orders, like three soft tacos, that take 10+ minutes.

Do you think if I start using the mobile ordering, there would be an easy way to order this to where the workers would easily understand what it is I want done?

So I bit the bullet and created a new account which once again was full of rewards, but today I tried to place an order and wasn't allowed to login until I changed my password.

Key_Nobody1850,"So the ""Number 7 with a soft shell taco"" has been a staple of my taco bell experience since I was a child. For those who are uninitiated, the combo includes a chicken quesadilla, crunchy taco, and a medium drink. This used to be comparable in price to everything else on the menu but over the last few years the quesadilla quality has gotten skimpier and skimpier while the price compared to everything else on the menu has increased. Of course prices always tend to rise over time but it seems like only recently the number 7 became the most expensive thing on the menu. 

I went to my local taco bell today and was shocked to see that the price AGAIN increased from 8 something which was already making me question my loyalties to the number 7, but was marked 9.49 before tax. I love my quesadillas to death but I can get 5 or 6 taco's for that price, 3 burrito's, or whatever 5.99 value box they have on special and get a drink with it too.

Proud_Truck,"So I posted a few days ago about how my local store out up a sign saying mobile orders need to come inside for pickup between 11am-11pm. This store still hands out forks and straws with every order despite state law changing on January 1st. Literally every other store has the sign up and asks if you want utensils but not this one so I figured this would be slowly implemented...

Made a mobile order at 10:25am, pulled up about 10:32. Usually by now the app would say it was being made since they ignore proper functionality but it didn't so I pulled into the empty drive thru. I waited so long I started to wonder if they were closed. Finally someone came on and simply said ""hello?"" Like I surprised them. Store opens at 8am btw. I said I have a mobile order, she says it's not ready yet (duh) and I need to pull into one of the new mobile ordering spots. So I drive around the store and park in one of the two spots. All the good spots at the front have employee cars in them which is not where employees are usually parked at a store but anyhoo, there's two spots.

While I'm waiting another dude does what I did and ends up having to drive around and pull in next to me. We both just look at each other and shake our heads. This is stupid. A few minutes go by and a woman comes out and asks if I'm so and so, I say yes and she hands me my food. I ask her ""I thought this was from 11 to 11?"" And she asks what I mean. I say ""the sign says 11am-11pm... It's 10:35..."" And she snaps back ""yeah that's why I brought it out to you. Otherwise you'd have to come in and get it"" then stomps back inside. I know this isn't her idea but don't defend this dumb shit idea and snap at me about it. 

To the exec who never eats at TB and thinks 2 mobile parking spaces are enough and that taking an employee out of the kitchen to run food is a good idea when they're already short handed, among all the other reasons this is stupid, don't act all surprised when business goes down at your store because I'm not putting up with it and others won't either.

The staff unfortunately at times unable to properly communicate and when asked politely for salsa or ketchup that is all out in the pickup area, they ether throw it at you or look at you like they are doing a favour.

I also had heard number of times employees talking in Creole [many ft Lauderdale and miami locations ] about customers really nasty things when I was eating inside, I regretted I speak french as I would of rather not heard that. And to be frank, would rather have a robot serve my food with 1 courteous and well trained staff member there.

Overall the quality went down so much that it's a gamble to get an item that smells fresh, is served without errors and actually have a courteous person take the order. They need to change or they will be lossing customers worse than ever before and they will not be able to claim loss because of economy or Cov1d.",Taco Bell became a cesspool of discourtesy ü§¢üëé,tacobell

I cannot get the Taco Bell Mobile App to work. 

The issue isn‚Äôt that the app doesn‚Äôt let me place the order, or that it crashes a lot (which it does), the problem is that for some reason, the customizations that I make to the items don‚Äôt actually translate to my order.

about a week ago I was working an evening shift at Taco Bell. Around 8pm or 9pm, some random guy walked into the restaurant and went immediately behind the counter. Company rules state you need both a mask (at least in my area) and a uniform to go into the back of the house. This guy had neither. He went to the manager's office and began to talk some slurred gibberish about how he works here and needs to pick up a paycheck. He didn't work here so we told him he had to leave. He shrugged a bit and walked away, but instead of going out of the lobby he went to the drive-thru and climbed out the window. He fell face-first on the ground, laid there for a few moments, then got up and walked away. Luckily the drive thru was empty at the time so no one saw it. Looking back, I think the guy may have been on drugs.","Customer walks behind counter, talks gibberish, then leaves thru the drive-thru window",tacobell

Any Taco Bell exec worth their salt should‚Äôve known this is an item that was begging to be served grilled.

The thing also has too many sauces on it which clash. Chipotle, Nacho Cheese, AND Sour Cream? And then remember most people like to add Mild, Hot or Fire after the fact! It‚Äôs like a soggy diaper full of soup.

All those sauces mixed together also drown the fries themselves, meaning any semblance of crispiness is long gone. It‚Äôs all just sauce and mush, with the odd piece of dog food steak here and there.

fenpark15,"I had a Fire reward to use so I ordered a Nacho Bell Grande and a soft taco.  The total using the reward was just under $2.  In the drive thru I didn't check my order and it turned out I got the wrong food.  I received: 1 chicken quesadilla, 1 crunchy taco, 1 bean burrito, 2 cheese rollups with chicken.  

I really like the chicken quesadilla but rarely order it because of the price/value.  The taco and burrito were a good additional variety. The chicken&amp;cheese melts were kind of a waste because too similar to the quesadilla but more dry and bland.  

I hope I didn't ruin anyone else's day by taking their food (if they check their bag TB will make it right for them), but it was not such a bad experience for me.

TaylorS2K,"Hey Taco Bell Lovers, 

I wanted to share a few tips and tricks I have learned over the years while ordering Taco Bell. Comment if you have any suggestions of your own! (Dollar amounts may vary) 

1.) Always order through the app when possible. 
- Free rewards occasionally
- Items are almost totally customizable 
- Early access to new items
- Exclusive app-only items such as ‚Äúbuild your own $5 box‚Äù 
- Rewards Points (1$ = 10 points, 250 points per reward) so basically every $25 you could get $4 back if you order the Nachos Bell Grande. 

2.) There are free add-on‚Äôs to certain items 
-You can grill burritos for no extra cost 
-Adding red sauce is no extra cost 

3.) Use your reward points wisely 
-This is kind of a no brainer, but probably best to use your free points on the more expensive items such as Nachos Bell Grande if you have reached Fire level rewards 

4.) You can still customize free rewards 
-You can add and remove items and it will still deduct the original price of the item 

5.) Make it easy for the workers to get your order right 
-Now this may only be coincidental, but I have noticed that if I remove several ingredients from an item, 90% of the time they will get it right. However, if I remove several ingredients and then I start to add additional ingredients, 50% of the time those removed ingredients end up in my food. 
Again this may just be coincidental, but I believe it has to do with the way the workers see the removed/added items on their screens while preparing the food. 

6.) The $5 box will almost always be the cheapest way to get the most out of your money (calorie to dollar ratio).
- I personally always start my order with a $5 box and then go from there. For most people the $5 box will be enough in itself, but I do understand some people want variety.",Taco Bell Ordering Tips &amp; Tricks,tacobell

JaneDoe_98765,"The taco pass has been singing its siren song to me ever since it was released. I‚Äôve resisted temptation so far. How? By imagining the 20+ lbs I would gain by eating a Taco Bell taco every day for a month. Plus, I think I would get sick of them pretty quickly. 

But the taco pass exists; therefore, I want it. Time to figure out a solution. The Taco Bell gods answered my prayers when I read a post on here about freezing tacos. Apparently, there‚Äôs a person who‚Äôs been getting a soft taco every day with the pass and freezing most of them. Is she/he crazy? Or crazy like a fox? I needed to find out.

I am pleased to announce the results of The Great Frozen Taco Experiment today. My test subjects were a regular soft taco and a spicy potato taco. No lettuce. Let me repeat that. No lettuce.

After freezing them for about 36 hours, I reheated both tacos in my convection toaster oven. They were good! The tortillas got a little crispy during reheating, which I liked. I dipped them in a mixture of salsa &amp; sour cream. The potatoes were kind of dry &amp; really needed it.

Conclusion: The experiment was a success. It *is* possible to use the taco pass to create a stash of decent frozen Taco Bell tacos for emergency use. Do I need this? Hell no. Will I do it anyway? Probably.

rayjr1806,"First of all we all know it but I'll say it again, that damn taco is EXPENSIVE.

now my cantina taco suffered from the same ""lack of chicken"" everyone else has been experiencing BUT I must say with the avocado ranch it's the closest thing I'll get to a OG McDonald's snack wrap for a long time and I love them for that. For what little there was in comparison to the 2.80 it cost me the thing was fucking delicious.

Now onto the flaming hot cool ranch... I will give it to them that when they say hot they mean hot. I used to love spicy food but stoped due to stomach issue so I have had the hottest of the hot and that taco doesn't mess around. Sadly the cool ranch flavor while good wasn't AS good as what I remembered but God damn it was still tasty and definitely lived up to expectations.

All in all it was a good day and I even got an extra free Doritos locos taco on the app for signing up so that was cool. All the tacos were good but sure as hell weren't worth the pretty penny their hype justified them to be priced at. 

Maybe if they stopped spending so much money on sauce it wouldn't be an issue.

Reidzyt,"So here's my most recent experience.

&amp;#x200B;

I got a call from my dad offering to pick up food for me since he was in the area. So I ordered on the app and he picked it up for me. I ordered at 3:45pm. Due to the lobby being closed, the drive thru line being absurdly long, and the fact that it is a 20 minute drive to my place, I didn't get my food until 4:30. No big deal. Except that my (simple) order was wrong. 

&amp;#x200B;

I ordered 2 beefy melt burritos. For those that don't know these come with the following: beef, 3 cheese blend, nacho cheese sauce, sour cream, rice, and fiesta strips. I normally order these but without the sour cream or the rice. So 2 burritos with meat, the two types of cheeses, and fiesta strips. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I opened my burritos they were FULL of lettuce and tomatoes, two items that aren't even normally in the burritos. After the day I had I simply wanted what I paid for. So I drove back down and got to the drive thru. The line was still absurdly long and the lobby was closed so I tried calling to see if I could just come in and grab a remade order. They said hop in the drive thru and we got you. I was polite and so was the staff, mistakes happen no big deal.

&amp;#x200B;

Until I got my second bag now. After pulling away I parked in the lot and checked to see if it was correct this time and low and behold it was still wrong. So I pulled back up waited in line again and said ""Its me again I'm sorry I hate to be that guy but this still isn't what I ordered"" they asked what specifically was wrong and what specifically I ordered. Pulled up a third time and the girl at the window this time wasn't so polite gave me my food and shut the window quickly. 

&amp;#x200B;

I pulled into the lot to check it again and this time it had EVEN MORE lettuce and tomatoes in them. I tried calling and they wouldn't answer so I went up to the lobby door. They were motioning for me to go to the drive thru and I held up three fingers, and my three bags of messed up orders and said ""I already did three times."" Someone came out and asked what was going on and I explained what was happening. 

&amp;#x200B;

After a fourth attempt and TWO hours I finally got my correct order on what will probably be my final trip to my local Taco Bell.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it me or is this unacceptable? Like I wasn't a dick or anything I wasn't mad when pulling up. I get the mistake the first time and even chatted with the employees at the pay window the first time I asked for the right order while waiting in line, but to mess up something so simple THREE times and make me have to try coming inside after waiting 2 hours seems like that's not ok",Had to get my order remade FOUR times with a TWO HOUR wait before finally getting it right,tacobell

I thought she was just going to hang up but no, she goes on to say "" yah? Then mabey you should go kill yourself, put the gun up to your head and shoot, go eat tide pods or something"". I was in disbelief. Mind you that was the first time he called. I didn't believe what just happened so he gave me the number and I called. Everything I just heard was real so for about 30mins I keep calling to piss her off. She apparently tracked where I live and gave my info to the cops. I know I was also wrong but get this girl fired.

WorkingPanda_334,"I would like to acknowledge that there are many Taco Bell franchises and they decide who does and does not work for them. But at the same time, I don't believe they are interviewing enough people in order to meet the demand that the restaurants occur on a daily basis. 

For example, there can be a few stores with 3 people on at a time and a 2 hour drive-thru only wait. If Taco Bell had interviewed more people, they may have found more candidates they felt were ""qualified"" to work at the establishment. 

What I would do is integrate a program that allows the team to ""thumb up"" or ""thumb down"" an applicant and if they ""thumb up"" an applicant that person gets an email with a set of times they can come in to interview at a location and management can have lobbies open during that time and have do all the interviews for people that arrive, ""Thumb down"" would send an email saying ""Thank you for your interest in Taco Bell, at this time we are considering other applicants.""

I‚Äôve always loved Taco Bell, and like many of you, I‚Äôd consider myself a hardcore fan.

However I wouldn‚Äôt be the first person to notice a sharp increase in price, as well as a steep decline in quality. A meal at Taco Bell costs as much as one at Chipotle or Rubios, yet the quality of the ingredients is reminiscent of the freezer aisle at the grocery store.

The other day I stopped by Del Taco, a southern Californian rival of the Bell, and for $4.50 I got myself two chicken tacos with fresh grilled chicken, hand shredded cheese, and house made guacamole, as well as a  bean tostada (which is significantly larger and crunchier than Taco Bell‚Äôs tostada ever was)

Along with that, their tacos are so much better than Taco Bell‚Äôs, yet they cost nearly half as much. And despite the lower prices, their food is noticeably higher quality, a big part of their brand is their fresh vegetables.

So as fans of Taco Bell, when did we accept the way they treat us? It is obvious they do not care about us, Del Taco has proven that they are capable of providing a quality product at the absurd prices they charge, yet they feed us dog food. It is an insult to those who have been loyal for so long. I love Taco Bell, and I‚Äôll surely eat some in the near future, however every time I scarf down an overpriced potato taco, I always feel a guilty feeling that I never feel with their competitors.

I miss the old Taco Bell. I know you all feel the same.",Del Taco&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Taco Bell,tacobell

Moonlight_Melody123,"Think about it. You pay $10 for 30-days of a free taco of your choosing. The most expensive taco is the Doritos locos supreme at $2.99 (more or less depending on location). Say you eat one taco a day,

2.99(30) = $89.7 - pretax

What's strange is that it's still bundled with cinnamon twists in the app OR when you start an online order through the website.

What's up with that?  Is it just some sort of strange error on the website or is Taco Bell really going to be rolling out an updated version of the box soon?

dev1359,"The first one is two minutes from my house, when I got there around 11:45 they said they can't make my mobile order for me because they aren't making orders past 11. When I asked why, I was told they don't have enough people working. Luckily they hadn't accepted my mobile order yet so I was able to cancel it. I then put in an order at another location 12 minutes east of me. 

When I got to that one there was no one there. No one at the window to take my order, no cars outside, but all the lights inside were on and everything inside seemed to be turned on and running. I assumed the employees on shift either bailed and went somewhere or were hiding from me, lmao. 

So I canceled that mobile order and drove out to one about 15 minutes west of my house. I was the fifth car in line and as I waited, more and more cars started to pile up in line behind me while we waiting forever. By this point it was around 12:30. The line would only move forward one car for like 15 to 20 minutes at a time. 

By the time I got to the speaker, no one was answering. I sat and waited for ten minutes, then slowly started to realize the cars in front of me all drove off rather than received their orders.

I couldn't cancel my mobile order at this point, because for some reason it said it was already completed and ready to be picked up. So I rolled up to the window after sitting at the speaker for 10 minutes. By this point in time, there are about 15 or so cars in line behind me, stretching down across the Bealls Outlet parking lot.

No one's at the window. I sit and wait at there for another 20 minutes. Eventually, around 1:10 AM the manager appears out of nowhere and opens the window, I tell him I have a mobile order that the app says is ready for me. He says they don't have any mobile order for me because they're closed. When I look at him with a WTF? look on my face, he then further elaborates by saying they've closed early because he doesn't have any workers to make my order. 

At this point I'm not really sure what to do. I can't cancel my order in the app and my card has now been charged for the $20.12 that my order came up to. 

I guess I have to call the corporate number on Monday? When I've tried to reach the Taco Bell Cares Twitter account in the past they don't respond to my DMs.

Exact-Avocado_,"So for context, I am fully vaccinated &amp; boostered but I started getting mild COVID symptoms this past Monday and I tested positive for COVID on Tuesday. On day 4 of symptoms (so on Thursday of this week) things started to smell super strange to me. The best way I can describe it is that certain things smelled like a nasty vinegar (I like vinegar but this is like a disgusting version of vinegar). Luckily I haven‚Äôt lost my sense of smell/taste but some things do not taste the same.

I was devastated today when I ate my favorite Taco Bell item ever (cheesy gordita crunch) and the spicy ranch sauce, which is truly my favorite taste of all time, tasted like nasty/overwhelming vinegar. I looked at the ingredients and sure enough, vinegar is one of them. But it‚Äôs like the vinegar is the ONLY ingredient I could taste. Everything else tasted fine and delicious as always. And then I remembered that whenever I get a cold, this always happens to me with ketchup.

I know it‚Äôs been hard on workers due to Covid and increased demand, and I think this issue could probably be solved by actually paying the workers a living wage.

Another thing is that my location is still frequently closed for indoor so drive-thru is the only option and it‚Äôs impossible to check the whole bag and everything in it to see if upgrades are accurate, while people are waiting in line behind you (and then even if you pull over and check, going back through the drive-thru ‚Äî not to mention even going inside almost every time if it was open ‚Äî can take forever).

Well the lady hands me my order and my drink, I then proceeded to drive home, as soon as I get home and step of the car the cardboard box handle rips and gives, then all 12 tacos go straight to the ground. I‚Äôm not sure if this is common but defo won‚Äôt go back to Taco Bell now. I wasted 40 mins driving, and $23 and never even got to eat a single taco.","taco bell visit, not impressed",tacobell

Additional_Fall2485,"Around Nov 2020- January 2021 I worked in Taco Bell, and they didn't give me a schedule for a month and I called to ask about the schedule and why I was not included in the schedule. The manager told me that they don't need me, and when I looked at the schedule, everyone was new on the schedule. So for a month, I waited for nothing, and I was forced to look for another job which was a bit of an inconvenience. Working there: I had to buy my own uniforms, they didn't supply the uniforms new recruiters needed. 

Someone told me I should complain about it to the hotline anonymously, but I don't think I'm covered since it happened almost a year ago ( next month it will be a year). No one really guided me to what to do so I solved it in my own way. They never called me back or put me on the schedule.

xYamax,"Title. Sorry if this post has already been made before, I couldn't find anything about it within the past week or so. They just keep doing this crap bro, at least at my location. ""Dollar Craving Menu"" is $1.39 and all that, other menu items are anywhere from 50 cents to a dollar more from what they used to be. That's why I was really excited for the Cravings Box, especially after I got a gift card this Christmas. It sounded too good to be true or that it was a scam because the total value of all the items normally would easily come to almost double the price, but it wasn't a scam! It made me think they were totally crazy or something, but no, everything was as it should've been and delicious.

But here they go, they've already bumped up the price. Goes to show that the saying is true, nothing good lasts forever. I wouldn't be so ticked off if I wasn't still getting advertisements saying that it's $5, I don't care if they have any fine print caveats anywhere that could say the price varies, still disingenuous. I'm not educated at all on the behind the scenes matter, but I feel as if they still make a good profit margin on every sale, regardless of the current situation we've been living in for the longest time now, they're a mega chain after all. On that exact point, if the behind the scenes was a problem and causing the price to rise, why wasn't the price higher to begin with? I'm pretty sure the pandemic induced conditions would be better now than what they used to be a year ago, but again, I'm not an expert.

I swear, it's all been downhill ever since they did their menu cuts a couple years or so back, I forget. There's just been less and less incentive to keep coming back which sucks because, you can say I have bad taste, I genuinely enjoy the food.

Anyway, my rant is over. If you've made it this far, thanks for reading.

gavindavisjones,"As a vegetarian, I love Taco Bell because they are one of the only fast-food restaurants that have endless options for people who don't eat meat. I have eaten their meat before when they have gotten my order wrong and I was past the point of turning around to go get the correct order. I can honestly say that the items that I substitute refried beans for beef are a million times better with refried beans. Next time you go try:

Supreme Chalupa with refried beans instead of beef, add creamy jalapeno.  
Crunchwrap Supreme with refried beans instead of beef, add creamy jalapeno.  
Cheesy Bean and Rice Burrito (grilled).

These items have been my staple for years. The refried beans with creamy jalapeno create a flavor burst and combination that can not be duplicated.

booyamachines,"My son had a late night game last night, he picked Taco Bell as his meal (it was a rough game), so I downloaded the app so I could order and pick up on the way home.

The app insists that I reset my password, I hit send e-mail, no e-mail comes.  I hit retry send e-mail, an e-mail comes, I immediately click it and it says the link is expired (repeat 2x).  Finally I just order without logging in.  I'm starving, I'm tired, I've been eating well, so my order ends up being just under $50 (family of 4) and the first thing on the app is the new chicken wings, so what the hell, I added those too.

Hit the drive thru:

""Hi I'm picking up an order for /u/booyamachines""

""uhhh, just so you know we don't have those chicken wings any more...""

""Um, ok...as long as I'm not charged for them that's fine.""

""No, you have to get a refund through the app.""

I fumble around with the app, my order info is gone because I couldn't log in so there is no history.  There is certainly nothing that obviously points to a method for obtaining a refund.

""I don't see how to get a refund.  Y'know what just give me the rest of the food and I'll pay for the whole thing, don't worry about it.""

""No, my manager says I can't do that.  You have to get a refund through the app.""

Again, sitting in the drive through I'm fumbling through this app confused why they won't give me any of the $50 order I have already paid for.

""Well can your manager tell me how to get a refund through the app because I don't know how to do it!?""

(cutting me off and yelling through the speaker)  
""SIR YOU HAVE TO GET A REFUND THROUGH THE APP!""

I'm done with this stupid app and cannot believe they are refusing to give me food.  I've offered two solutions to them and asked for help when they were rejected, yet all I get is escalating anger through the speaker.

""Ok, see you later, and FUCK OFF!""  I drive off.

Please don't think I'm proud of the ""fuck off"" I was at the end of my wits and could not believe how I was being treated.

Trying to get my money back I look through the dumbass app again to contact Taco Bell and the only thing available is a feedback form, which I fill out and recount this story and then clicked the box requesting to be contacted.

galspanic,"I‚Äôve been a more-than-regular Taco Bell consumer for 30 years now (my physique can attest to this) and first moved from Fark to Reddit in 2006, but today is the first time I ever thought about connecting those two dots in my life.  A few things have come up recently that I need you all to chime in on.

First, am I the only person who has started paying the $3.38 Taco Bell Tax on every order?  Every single time I order from the one nearest to me they forget 2 items.  Usually it‚Äôs 2 soft tacos or 2 bean burritos, so I have to order two extra just to make sure I get everything when I get home.  I could dig through my bag, but after waiting for 15 minutes in the drive through I‚Äôm not about to wait another 15 minutes to correct the order.  It‚Äôs worth $3.38 to just get home.

Second, a few years back I got to try various experimental menu items - including the XXL Burrito.  But, I thought the one they were calling the King Carne Burrito was one of the better things I‚Äôve ever had at Taco Bell, and I never saw it again.  Has anyone ever seen this one in the flesh?  Does anyone remember what was in this one?

Third, back in 1993 there was a burrito called The Volcano Burrito that is definitely not the one most of you are thinking of.  They had the one discontinued around 2012-2013, the movie tie-in from Congo in  1995, and then the best burrito I‚Äôve ever had that I wonder if it was a local thing (Like Mitch Hedberg serving McSpaghetti).  It had a large tortilla, pepper Jack cheese, pickled jalape√±os, and the steak was some precursor to what steak later became.  It was all laid flat, steamed to melt the cheese, and then rolled.  If I recall, they followed the normal trajectory of starting at $.99 and crept up to $1.49-$1.69.  Then, by the end of 1994 they vanished.",A few questions.,tacobell

90percenttacos,"I used my free fiesta veggie burrito reward today. I almost gave up on it after the first few bites because it was all black beans and rice and it was super bland, but once I got to the part of the burrito that had all the components it was very tasty, so I'm glad I stuck with it, which I probably would not have done had my crunch wrap not had that weird bitter, kind of rancid oil flavor to it. I hadn't ordered a crunch wrap in a while, so that was disappointing. I think I need to avoid this taco bell again. They were doing better for a while, but it seems like at least half the time I go recently I get at least one item with that nasty bitter oil flavor and it has been happening at the other Taco Bell location I usually go to because the closer one is bad occasionally also, though not nearly as frequently. I wish I knew what it was. They don't fry these items in the store so it shouldn't be the fryer oil, so it has to either be something happening at the place they buy the shells/chips or something going wrong with how they store them or how long they sit under the heat lamps or something.

thebestbooyah,"I want to start out by saying that I love Taco Bell, I truly do. It breaks my heart what has been happening to it lately and I wanted to post on here and see if others felt the same way that I do about a beloved fast food chain that has been one of my favorites ever since I was a kid.

Things seem to have changed so much. It seems like Taco Bell is trying to cater itself to some imaginary upscale audience that doesn‚Äôt realize what Taco Bell is. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm articulating that correctly, but that is the vibe that I get.

Specifically my biggest grievance is with removing some of the best menu items. I‚Äôm not going to list them all, but one that really sticks out for me is the Double Decker Taco. 

I loved the Double Decker. 

I remember when I was in elementary school when it came out. It was such an amazing concept. A hard shell taco wrapped in a soft shell taco with beans? It blew my tiny little mind and remained my favorite menu item to this day.

There was no reason to remove this from the menu, no reason at all whatsoever. The only possible reason I came up with is that some executive at Taco Bell had an ex girlfriend who loved the Double Decker and he removed it to spite her. That‚Äôs the only possible explanation for removing such a beloved item from the menu.

Let‚Äôs think about this for a minute. All the ingredients that are needed to make the Double Decker Taco still exist. In fact, the other night I decided to try and get the items myself to make one. I ordered a crunchy taco supreme, and then I had to explain to my drive-through attendant that I wanted a bean soft taco. A soft taco tortilla with just beans. No lettuce, no cheese, just beans. 

They reluctantly made my order and I was able to go home put the crunchy taco inside of the soft bean taco and relive my fond memories of the Double Decker. 

Let me tell you something friends, it was amazing.

There are several other menu items that were favorites that have been discontinued, and unfortunately there‚Äôs no way to relive those memories. Looking at you, Mexican Pizza.

I‚Äôm going to just say it‚Ä¶ These moves are dumb. The executives at Taco Bell are completely out of touch. This is a prime example of the disappearance of the middle class and how rich fast food executives do not understand working class people.

When these changes started to happen I thought maybe Taco Bell was trying to go back to the basics and simplify the menu. However, the items that they chose to keep do not make any sense to me at all.

Then I thought Taco Bell was maybe trying to distance itself from stoner culture. The next thing I know they are releasing Chalupa‚Äôs with some sort of a fried chicken shell? I don‚Äôt understand.

What exactly is Taco Bell trying to do? Who are you catering to? What is the end game?

Honestly, I think the entire board of directors at Taco Bell needs to be replaced.

These shenanigans have gone on long enough. As a working class individual myself, I say no more. It‚Äôs time for us working class people to get what we deserve.

We deserve our Mexican Pizza.

We deserve our Grilled Stuffed Burrito.

BrindlePity,"I‚Äôve got a lot of decently inebriated energy in my right now (as a fair amount do when they seek out Taco Bell on a Saturday night at this time), so this post is going to have some punch. Forgive me.

I‚Äôll quickly state that I‚Äôm the biggest Taco Bell fan there could be, I know many of you would claim that title, but many of you didn‚Äôt have a Taco Bell themed 12th birthday party. I rest my case. 
The point:

Every time I go to Taco Bell and get a quesadilla and they don‚Äôt have creamy jalape√±o sauce, they‚Äôll simply just make it without it, give it to me, and say nothing. I‚Äôve come to think that there‚Äôs one reason for another for this, but this has legitimately got to be the 20th time this has happened and I‚Äôm DONE. 

There are only THREE INGREDIENTS IN THIS MOTHERF********. How am I NOT going to notice?! The sauce MAKES the quesadilla. If I wanted a quesadilla with just cheese and meat I‚Äôd go to Carlos‚Äôs truck down the road. (bless you, Carlos. Amazing food. I‚Äôm sorry I drug you into this.) If anybody at ANY LOCATION would just say ‚ÄúHey! We don‚Äôt have the sauce, and that‚Äôs literally a third of the entree. Do you want something else?‚Äù I would say ‚ÄúWhy YES! PLEEEAAASE!‚Äù But no. Here I am, almost drunk, and almost happy, with a dry ass quesadilla that I didn‚Äôt pay two thirds of the price for.

Always a 40+ minute wait, and even longer in dining room, even without line. They want online orders picked up online but the cashier just walks around on phone and doesn't make eye contact with people waiting so she doesn't have to acknowledge that she has a job or something... finally, I get someone's attention for help, and see that cashier run outside to a car that someone else went to, did some exchange- just to run in, and pull away the person who was about to help me...

Coram, NY. 
I ordered for a bunch of people we had over, it was $30+ of food at least. I waited 56 minutes, finally got to the window and asked if this was all of the order because it seemed light.... She said nastily, ""yeah, now move up because we have a line."" I start driving and see that I had $8 of food in the bag... They were missing basically everything. I had to go back on line for 40 minutes and they got mad that I returned, took my bag to ""double check"" and then told me it was my fault I took the wrong order .. meanwhile I asked them to double check. 

Selden, NY. 
Drive through always circles around the building like sharks looking for dinner...  I go park at 745pm and see an employee lighting her second cigarette..  ask I walk up she says "" we are closed now."" I kindly asked if she could pull the mobile orders, as I already have a different order in the car and can't wait at least 45 minutes for this order and jam up my orders and let them get cold... ""Oh well, you can wait on the line outside... "" 
... Okay, well that order must be canceled then. Sorry, Bye.

Orioles1019,"Small, yes. But that was to be expected. I was right about my prediction on them being those annoying wings that have more grisly parts than you'd like. Overall, they're just a mixed bag. Some deformed. Some good size and shape. 
They actually were crispy, to my surprise. The chicken itself was really good juicy chicken. The seasoning is the stuff they put on their fries. Usually not a fan bc on the fries they put WAY too much and it's overwhelming. On the wings, perfect amount. Seasoning isn't even noticeable if you're just munching away at them. I didn't notice it until I thought about the seasoning and went ""Oh yea there it is"", if that makes sense. At first I thought it wasn't enough seasoning, but quickly changed my mind on it. Perfect amount of seasoning so that they taste like normal chicken wings but have a little taco bell twist to them. 
Also dipping them in the ranch is great, bc ranch is great. Perfect combo. 
Overall, 8/10. If grading taste alone, 10/10 easy. But the deformities and different sizes and shapes and grisly parts take away a fair bit.

~BEEF~

I see people saying this one is filling and worth the $1 price increase from the old beef burrito, personally, I disagree. This is a beef burrito with two types of cheese and added sour cream, I wouldn‚Äôt get this again but it was an item that had classic Taco Bell taste. Definitely could benefit from fire sauce.

~CHICKEN~

I see people saying this one is the best, and I absolutely agree. The mix of chipotle and ranch with the chicken which is normally a ‚Äúpremium‚Äù meat at Taco Bell makes for a tasty treat. Throw in the fiesta strips, cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes to make this quite a rounded out and satisfying burrito. Worth the $2 and a rock solid. (8.5/10)

~VEGGIE~

Taco Bell has just gotten to the point it's not longer worth it the risk of something being trash.  Sure, it can be delicious, but it's just like a gamble and I don't want to keep going and supporting them just so I can have thigns wrong, bc they don't wnat to pay more just so they can charge Lil Nas X, or whatever issues they can't figure out.  And don't think Nas X isn't the only person that is paid well.  It's a corporation and there are tons of people making 100K, 200K, 500K, and 1M+ per year.  

Taco bell aka Yum Brands just can't figure out the operations side of a fast food franchise.  They are better at marketing than they are at running actual restaurants

But just a mild reward coupon for a small soda or bean burrito etc for free, even though my order was $5

Fast forward to last week I put another mobile order in, went to go get it and oddly my go to Taco Bell was closed, for some reason it was shut down all last week. Couldn‚Äôt cancel the order because it was already being made when I got there even though the store was pitch black. Instead of contacting support I waited it out until tonight I noticed they were open. It‚Äôs my frequent Taco Bell and I go there a few times a week so I figured maybe they could refund me or just give me what I ordered since it was about $7-8.

Sadly she said they don‚Äôt have control over mobile orders and I had to cancel it in the app, I said I couldn‚Äôt because it was marked as completed and I did it last week not realizing you guys were closed. She said she understood nothing she can do about app orders. So I contacted support on Twitter this time instead of email hoping more can be done.

He works on average 4 days a week for roughly 5-8 hours. Doing the math I figured out he should be being payed AT LEAST $560 (5hx14$x8).

Although they use an app, their schedule is ALWAYS on a handwritten piece of paper (barely legible) that the manger just takes a picture of and posts on the app. They are not able to put their availability or take time off on the app. It has to be on a piece a paper at work, so you can only do any scheduling stuff when you‚Äôre at work.

Zoe_Grace_2019,"I've used the Taco Bell a few times now and out of those few times, twice, I have had issues with orders being messed up and me unable to cancel the order and get my money back. The first issue was when I made an order on the app for the Taco Bell down the street in Florida but after paying, my order went to a Taco Bell in Indiana! The next issue was ordering on the app and having the option to pick up the order ""In Store."" I get to the store after I have paid via the app and my order was ready but the lobby was closed. I was directed through the glass doors by an employee to go get in the drive thru line which was LONG. Speaking through the glass doors of the Taco Bell, I told the employee that the app said I could pick it up in the store and could she should pass it to me through the doors. NOPE! I was told again, to get in line. I then said I want my money back and was told to cancel the order the app. However, once the order is being made, you no longer have the option to cancel the order. Also, this was at 8:30 p.m. at night. The store lobby was closed because they didn't have enough staff working. ??? Also, my order was ready and I was going to wait to pick up soggy food? Wow! Just wow!

So, I've given Taco Bell almost $30 bucks now for nothing. I've tried the ""Contact Us"" on the app and its a joke. I've asked for money back weeks ago for the first issue (Indiana Taco Bell) and no one has contacted me. They are just keeping the money.

maccodemonkey,"Basically I need a refund for an online order - but I'm not sure the best way to get it.

I placed an online order, and arrived at the store about 10 minutes after placing (well before their posted closing hours). They were in the process of blocking off the drive thru with cones and sending everyone away. So I left and got food somewhere else. (Only their drive thru was open, so I couldn't go in.)

Later that night, my order was marked as completed and my card charged! I sent an online support request, but it's been a few days and I haven't heard back. I didn't know about placing a chargeback and if that would cause them to ban my online account. And I've seen people saying that online support has never gotten back to them.

We get to the store and wait in the drive through for about 10 minutes, we get to the speaker and state that we have two mobile orders, and they then tell me they can only do one order. I restate that they're mobile orders and already placed and were here to pick them up. They reiterate only one order per car. I sit there dumb founded for about 10 seconds and say I would like to pickup my two orders, they just keep stating one order per car, I ask them what they're talking about, why? And they continue to say the exact same thing. So at this point I say, what the fuck. And then it's silence for a full minute. I'm still sitting there waiting when someone else comes on and says that they can only check in one order or they can cancel them. I restate, no I want both of my orders. They say they can't and they only have two employees working. All the while this exchange had taken a solid 2 to 3 minutes. Finally I say just cancel them. Wait in the line for another 2 minutes and get to the window. The window employee reaches for the window then recoils back from the window and walks away for a solid minute. She comes back and says they can only do one order per car. That's the only line she says till later. I try to ask them to explain what they're even talking about and how it takes just as long to make my food if it's on one or two orders. They say they can check them in but I have to come back around. I ask them to check them both in and I'll pull back around since they won't budge. They say ok and I pull around. Get to the speaker and they say are you the mobile orders, yes, pull up. Get to the window and they hand me one order. I sit there for a second waiting and then the girl comes back up and says they can only do one order per car. I thought she was fucking with me because she said it two more times while I was just staring at her slack jawed. She goes away and someone else comes up (I've now interacted with 4 different people) he says they haven't checked in the other order and I need to pull around again... i just say ok if that's what it takes to get my food.

I understand that someone came in and decided to get rid of this tier strategy. And I definitely understand that their Quality pillar didn‚Äôt last. But honestly they seem to have forgotten that Price and Quantity were the ways people like to eat Taco Bell.

I like the cheesy gordita crunch, but it can feel too heavy. So my two staples were double decker tacos and Mexican pizzas. When they got rid of those I was gutted, but I coped by adding red chips or fritos to the quesarito. But when they removed fritos and then red chips, I really had nothing to draw me in. 

But the steak grilled cheese burrito and its red chips totally have me back. I asked the drive through lady and she said its only temporary, but while the red chips are around you can just ask them to put them in any order. So every burrito can have a crunch again. But honestly I don't even need to cuz the Steak Grilled Cheese Burrito is pretty fire. I'm trying to go more veggie in the new year so I'm gonna eat as many as I can this month before switching to black beans. Once they remove the red chips again I hope they add another source of crunch, since right now I'm really enjoying having something to crave at Taco Bell again.

WeWannaKnow,"The QUESARITO

Hear me out - I'm PISSED. Like, so pissed. And sad.

I'm Canadian. And I love Taco Bell. Not the Canadian Taco Bell. The American one. They're similar, but different. 

Today, Canadians can finally travel for a few hours to the USA and back without an expensive test.

My husband and I used to travel from Montreal to Plattsburgh, NY once a month just to go to Taco Bell. It's like a 1 hour drive. Then, COVID happened and they closed the border.

AND to add to my pain, they closed ALL the Taco Bell in Quebec in 2021.

I was SO excited to finally go to the American Taco Bell again. The last time I had Taco Bell before today? March 2020. That's like an eternity without it for me.

Sidenote: My husband died a month ago very suddenly at work and it's been hell to deal with it. I REALLY needed today to go flawlessly. Today's Taco Bell order was supposed to be a small ray of sunshine in my life after a month of heavy rain and fog.

I get to Taco Bell. Order my favorite.

Nope. Can't. Need the app.

I begged her to let me order the Quesarito. Explaining that I'm Canadian and don't have the app. Nope. Still can't cause ""the button doesn't exist for the quesarito""

Well guess what Taco Bell. The app isn't available to Canadians. It's not in my version of the app store.

Desperately needing my dearest Quesarito, I create a US account. Find the app, and open it.

Well, the app says Uh Oh something's wrong! And refuses to let me do anything because of some localisation issue.

Canadian phones are blocked from using the app.

musicmaniac32,"I don't have and don't want a Twitter account, but I keep hearing stories about people actually making a difference by tweeting at companies. If there's anyone else who is experiencing this, can you tweet at them for the good of all its patrons?

It's been like this all during the pandemic; the lines are absurd at all the Taco Bells I've gone to around where I live.

We all KNOW there's a labor shortage, but we also all KNOW that Taco Bell cut all the good things off the menu, so how long does it take to slap some faux (yet still delicious) ground beef into a shell or tortilla and wrap it up?

Usually I'll just leave when the line is out into the street, but tonight I said, you know what? I'm gonna do an experiment. So I was probably 6 or 7 cars from the window, and I say probably because I couldn't see the other side of the building and nothing was moving.

I decided to put my car in park (in line) and write out my rent check since it's the first of the month. In the time it took me to decide to do this, shift to park, find my phone, search my email to find my water bill amount, use my phone calculator to add that to my rent amount, write the check out, put everything away, sit, and then decide enough was enough and still nothing had moved.

I've learned from mistakenly getting into Taco Bell lines over the past year that I should always leave just enough room to be able to get out of line when it inevitably takes too long. Even in the next town over, it's the same way except at that location, they preface their greeting with, ""Sorry for the wait!""

Anyway, where I am, there is a Chipotle directly next to Taco Bell. So I got out of line, parked my car in the TB parking lot, walked about 50 ft over to Chipotle where the line was at the door (which was unusual for this location - definitely seems like they were understaffed, too), ordered, got my food, got back in my car, and drove around to the window side just to see if the car ahead of me was still in line, and IT WAS! OMG, it was!

Before you say, hey, why didn't you just go inside to order, let me tell you the TB lobby is closed and has been closed for months. 

Also, I don't know about y'all, but idling my engine in a drive thru is costing me gas money and destroying the planet, so I'm DEFINITELY ok with parking and walking to get my food. Please open the lobbies and give me the opportunity to do so.

But this is the real question: How is Chipotle faster than Taco Bell?! I really don't get it. If you work there, can you clue me into what's going on? If there's a legit reason things are like they are, I'll understand. I used to waitress and I know that customers can be unreasonable when they don't know what's going on behind the scenes.

Oh, and also, the locations around me have had to completely close from not having anyone to work there. If you ever see that there is no line at all, you will drive up and find a sign that says something to the effect of, ""closed due to lack of staff"" which, arguably, is better than what we saw when trying to go to the local Denny's. Their sign said ""closed due to lack of management."" Lol!) I don't think that being understaffed was the case tonight because 2 employees veeeeeery slowly and casually both took some trash to the dumpster while I was getting out of line to park and go to Chipotle. When it took longer at Chipotle than I thought it would, I was a little worried that they would call a tow truck because they saw me leave the premises, but they didn't, thank goodness.

Please clue me in because this is weird. All the other restaurants are slow, but TB is unnaturally slow for the VERY limited options they have on the menu (the only things I used to order, dating back to the 90s/early 2000s, were the 7-Layer Burrito, Cheesy Fiesta Potatoes, and Grilled Stufft Burrito and they took all of those away, so tbh, I don't even know why I bother. Only thing left I like is the beef burrito on the $1 menu.)

Is it that TB isn't treating/paying their employees right, so they don't want to work? I know Chipotle pays pretty well with benefits and PTO and such, but I've never heard or read anything about how TB compares in the industry. If you work there and feel neglected, please tell me and I'll stop going there all together. Don't believe me? I have never and will never patronize a Chik-Fil-A, I don't care how good y'all say it is. My will is strong.",Somebody tweet at Taco Bell that something is going wrong,tacobell

My ex was on a 'healthy living' kick, so prior to spring of 2021, I hadn't been to TB in years. Once I moved back in with my folks, they had a TB right up the street, so I started going all the time. In late June I signed up for the app and started going a few times a week. It was my comfort food when I was feeling like a failure (sad, I know).

With that being said, I saw someone had posted the details of the Friendsgiving package last week and I was pumped. At this point in my life I have found that I need to enjoy the small things. So I was pretty pumped when I saw that, as a 'Fire' rewards member (9044 points), I should've been expecting an email where I could sign up for the package and hang out with my friends and have a Taco Bell Friendsgiving meal on Wednesday, with Baja blast-based vodka cocktails.

1) Taco Bell's increase in prices. Please see the attached pictures. This is the main reason driving me away.

2) The new items brought to the menu are so ""eh"". I'm sorry but that chicken shell taco was terrible to me.  I got one of each, a regular and Jalapeno, the chicken tasted like a middle school cafeteria chicken patty that has been hanging out under the heat lamp all day and they messed up my order that day. Most of the new stuff is just the same 5 ingredients presented in a different way with a big price tag. This feels so underwhelming and money grabby and has felt that way for the last couple years. 

""What if we took the same ingredients.... and just.... formed the burrito into a triangle...""

""What if.... we took the same ingredients... and... hear me out.... put them in a burrito like normal but.... wait for it..... and melted cheese on top""

Every time I get a notification about a new item I cant help but chuckle. I know I'm going to open the APP and see the same 5 ingredients in a different way. It cracks me up. At this point its kind of impressive.

3) No matter what taco bell I go to, they are always out of something, the system is down, or my order got messed up.  After a couple years of this I just expect it at this point. I mentally have to choose "" if i go to this one, I cant get baja blast, but they usually get the order right"" or ""fuck, if i go to the one by my old house,  they will have baja blast but I will have to drive out of my way and wait 20 minutes in the drive through and hope they get the order right this time"". It is a true 21 century problem. I sound like I am complaining from an ivory castle.  I totally get COVID messed a lot of stuff up but I am not sure how the same taco bell has been out of baja blast for the last 6 months when there is a taco bell 3 miles away that does have it. 

4) If you upgrade your drink from a medium to a large with your meal, it is now 20 cents and not 10 cents. Yes, it's 10 cents, but when we found out you could upgrade a drink for 10 cents, you know we all lost it. You know we were all super happy about that. That was a definite guarantee every time I was upgrading my drink. 

Included in this post are a few pictures of the menu in my area. Please look at the cheese quesadilla picture. After Tax and everything you are looking at 4 dollars for a CHEESE Quesadilla. This is LITERALLY 3 ingredients and that's if they actually put the jalapeno sauce on. It's gotten so bad that I will literally just order the ""Jalapeno Sauce"" and go home to make the cheese quesadilla. After all, they are literally folding 1 tortilla shell in half.  It is 1 dollar for each piece of your quesadilla. That is brutal.

The new burrito was kind of the straw that broke the camels back. After tax you are looking at $6 dollars for a single burrito, which includes the SAME INGREDIENTS we have had for the last 10 years. It is just a new package for the same ingredients and feels really ""Money grabby"". For an extra dollar or two you could just go to your favorite authentic Mexican restaurant and get a ""Lunch""  special which includes chips, salsa and your meal. This is pure insanity to me and is driving me away from Taco Bell.

&amp;#x200B;

I am super grateful that Taco bell brought back Potatoes, I am grateful for the Taco Bell app that gives you reward points, I am grateful for the build your own 5 dollar box, I am grateful for Taco Bell being there for me on the bad days, but I am losing Confidence in Taco Bell given the reasons above and have been staying clear. I pray to the Taco Bell gods that there are better days ahead. I want to go to Las Vegas and visit the worlds biggest Taco Bell. That is a life goal of mine but given the prices in my Home State I can only imagine how brutally expensive the Las Vegas Taco Bell is.

However, is the purpose to also fill in the natural voids in the stone so that food doesn't get stuck inside?

LatteParaDos,"On r/mexico there recently was a thread about a user from Norway who made some nachos, users who claimed Nachos weren't Mexican on the comments were quickly corrected and told that nachos are a traditional dish in Coahuila.

So I stumbled upon this sub, and after scrolling I found out that many users here have claimed that Burritos and Nachos aren't Mexican food.

Guys, understand that Mexican food is heavily regional, Nachos were created in Piedras Negras and are a staple dish all over Northern Mexico. Burritos are literally a state dish in Sonora and Chihuahua and also a staple dish all over Northern Mexico.

Much of Tex-Mex gastronomy was imported from Northern Mexico, but that doesn't make Northern Mexican gastronomy any less ""authentic""

The worst offenders on this issue are mainly Mexican-Americans who believe that Burritos, Nachos and other Mexican dishes don't exist in Mexico because their family who comes from Central or Southern Mexico told them so. 

Even more extremist purists on Mexican food have gone as far as saying things such as:

""Flour tortillas are not a thing in Mexico"" 

""Only white people believe (insert actual Mexican dish here) is Mexican"" Even though Mexicans can be white too.

""(Insert Mexican dish here) is not Mexican food because I didn't find it in Cancun/Mexico City/Vallarta""",Please stop having purist views on Mexican food: Burritos and Nachos are authentic Mexican food like it or not.,mexicanfood

Meats:
Carnitas (shoulder + skin)
Carne asada al carbon
Pollo asado estilo sinaloa (I know chicken tacos aren‚Äôt very popular, but this is good, cheap, and easy-to-make. Not everyone in the group eats red meat.)

Tortillas: flour and corn (I‚Äôve found incredible fresh flour tortillas, still looking for good corn. Making by hand is not an option for this.)

Salsas:
Fresh avocado salsa (not spicy)
Chiltomate (will make spicy)

Sides/garnishes:
Chiles toreados
Nopalitos asados
Cebollitas asadas
Sliced cucumbers
Sliced radishes
Pickled red onions + habaneros
White onions / cilantro
Limes
Pickled carrots (worth making fresh? or canned?)
Potatoes (roasted? recommendations?)

Do you guys have tips on how to make it last longer? Preferably up to 7 days! It would really help!  

My recipe at the moment is 1 cup of rice, 2 cinnamon sticks, 1/2 cup of almond slices, 7.5 cups of water. Soak for 8-12hours. Blend many times.run through cheese cloth. 

Add 450ml of milk, 2.5 more cups of water, 10 grams of condensed milk, 2 tablespoons of vanilla essence, and lastly sugar and cinnamon sugar until it‚Äôs just the right sweetness. The actual drink tastes super delicious and tastes just like all the drinks I had when I was younger growing up in Mexico and San Diego.

Serendiplodocus,"Hi, I tried making taquitos yesterday, and had a bit of a failure rolling the tortillas.  I *think* they cracked because of their thickness, but here's what I did:

made the masa, let it hydrate for around 30 minutes, and then pressed into taco-sized tortillas from about a ping-pong/golf ball sized ball.

Then I used a really hot stainless steel pan to cook them, probably abot 2 mins on the first side and 1 minute on the second.  Enough to get a char on both sides.

Then they all went in a teatowel to steam together.  The ones at the bottom were probably in there for about 15 minutes.

At this point, I'll just say, we ended up having tacos, and the tortillas were delicious and perfectly pliable when we ate them about 10 minutes later.  I'd be happy with them normally.

but I proceded to heat some oil in a pan, and following the advice on a video, I pre-dipped the tortillas in the oil for about 3-5 seconds.  One got stuck and cooked for like 10 seconds and that one felt crispy coming out.

Then, while the tortilla was still hot, I tried to roll the first taquito and although it stayed together, it cracked pretty badly in three places.  It was what I was afraid of, but I used every trick I know to make them as pliable as possible.  If it is the thickness, that's more or less down to my press, plus the fact that they tend to break as I peel them off the plastic insert I use if they get too much thinner.

Has anyone some good, typical recipe for it and would like to share it with me?

I ordered the latter.  When the food arrived, the first thing I tasted were the rancho beans, which were barely above room temperature.  Several months ago I ate at the same place, and the rancho beans were tepid then, too.  Both times I sent them back to be heated.  (They were served in their own little bowl.)  **Am I just an ignorant Gringo who doesn't realize rancho beans are supposed to be tepid?**

Alternatively, their kitchen procedures could be in some ways ineffective.  I suspect this, because tonight the rice was barely warm.  In fact some areas within the rice were slightly cold to the tongue.  While the rice was presumably heated under a salamander with the enchiladas, it must have began pretty darn cold.

fried fish (sometimes batter includes mustard for color)
shredded green cabbage
crema (sometimes crema/mayo)
hot sauce or salsa (ex: salsa de arbol)
optional: pickled onions w/ oregano or salsa mexicana
served w/ lime

fried fish
pickled red cabbage
avocado salsa (sauce-like gaucamole)

cilantro
served w/ lime

fschwiet,"I am just wondering if there are any tricks to keep cilantro fresh.  Of course when I make tacos, they are ""con todo"" including onion and cilantro.  But when I buy a bundle a cilantro from the store most of it will go bad before I can use it.

I have tried freezing chopped cilantro, and that might work for cilantro to be cooked with but its not appetizing as a taco topper.

I have kept chopped cilantro with chopped onions in a container.  This seems to work the best.  I am not sure, maybe the onion is helping preserve the cilantro.  More than a week later yeah its not the freshest but the onions and cilantro taste good.

If I chop up cilantro and put it in a container by itself, it goes to crap in 2-3 days.  However I'm not sure its the lack of onion causing the problem, or the cilantro source.  Because when I kept both onion and cilantro in the same container it was cilantro I grew myself, so probably fresher than what I have from the store.

Ebvardh-Boss,"My nephew, who turned 16 starting this year, has lived with my wife and I since 12. He was born here but his parents raised him in Mexico, and he came here some years ago to study. My wife and I have always enjoyed his company. We have a lot of faith in him and we treat him as our own child.

For his birthday, we offered to take him wherever he liked and he said he wanted a nice Mexican restaurant. Living in the Bay Area, Mexican ‚Äústyle‚Äù was the best we could do and honestly we should‚Äôve just gone to a taco truck.

This place was an attack on the concept of Mexican food. My wife and I both ordered some frankly mediocre mole flautas, and he ordered a Surf &amp; Turf Molcajete.

Now, Molcajetes are something which I‚Äôve had more than once living in Mexico but apparently the cook at this establishment never has because this particular dish was a fucking abomination.

It was soupy but this was the least of its problems.

The meat was tough and stringy, they put half a wheel of panela cheese along with a whole leaf of nopal, and a link of chorizo.

If all that wasn‚Äôt enough, this thing had overcooked shrimp on it but it was mostly beans. BEANS. And not refried beans but partly cooked, undersalted whole-ass pinto beans.

He barely touched it and I felt so bad about it all that I told him on his next birthday I‚Äôll cook him a real Molcajete.

Well, it‚Äôs not his birthday yet. It‚Äôs mine. This weekend is my birthday and I want to take advantage of the fact that we‚Äôll fire up the grill to make him a badass dish.

I make a number of good dishes  at home, but nothing beats food from a good Mexican restaurant.  There are few things I can‚Äôt seem to get right at home.

I don‚Äôt think there is anything special about the sauce I get at the restaurant.  I‚Äôve had enchilada sauce at many restaurants that is just as good, if not better. I go to the one I go to because it is the most convenient.

I‚Äôm convinced that using the right chili is the most important part of the sauce.  It almost has to be.

This makes sense as Filipino longganisas are never cured but sold raw and needing to be cooked, much like Mexican chorizo. So where is this all going? Well i'm curious as to what sausage, chorizo, and longaniza varieties can be found in Mexico and how each one differs from the other. There are 8 mainstay longganisas in the Philippines, with more obscure varieties as you go from one province to the other.  What about in Mexico?

Also: I'm thinking of buying some Mexican groceries online for cooking Mexican food. What are the most essential things to buy? I'm thinking of starting with dried chillies / chilli powders. They have ancho, piquin, arbol, cascobel, pasilla, mulato, morita, etc etc.

What about achiote paste and epazote? And tomatillas?

Advice appreciated

I hope it's okay that I'm asking but I'm trying to find information regarding real authentic ways to make Mexican guacamole.

What are your authentic ways of making guacamole? What ingredience are an absolute must, which are optional and which should absolutely not be put in there! I hope you all can help me out.

mortimer__smith,"As the title states, I am gonna indulge in the art of making Birria de res. I have all the ingredients (except the meat and tortilla, but I'll get to that). It should be noted that this will be the first time I try a broth meal, and also first time I'm braising my meat instead of grilling or pan frying.

Any beginner tips? 

What sort of meat should I use? I am following Joshua Weissmans recipe and he calls for 3.0 pounds of meat (ca 1.6 kg), which frsnkly, I can't afford, and I will only make this for me and a friend. If I change the amount of meat to 900 g (a bit under 2 lb) but keep everything else the same, will my meal be ruined? I care deeply about this friend and I decidedly to don this challenge because he recently broke up with his gf, so i want this to be as good as it can be. The only place i know of locally that sells fresh beef has chuck steak, but I don't know where to find oxtail or short ribs. Any alternatives, that are also cheap? 

And the beef stock. Weissman insisted on homemade stock, but as of now, because of money and convenience, I got three buljong dice instead. is this acceptable, or will the taste be dramatically weakened like this?

Finally, the tortilla and cheese. It is impossible for me where I live to get Oaxaca cheese, which is the og cheese I should use. Will fresh mozzarella do? And the tortilla, I can get both flour and corn, i think, but will there be a noticeable difference in either?

I appreciate any little bit of guidance. I have wnated to make this for a long, long time:)",I am making Birria de res Quesetacos in a few days. Tips?,mexicanfood

Plus, it seems that within the past year or so they have switched to lower quality iron with broken handles being much more prevalent, though I know this is YMMV. I'd rather buy once, cry once and have a BIFL tortilla press. I do expect to use it frequently.  


From what I've gathered, Masienda's corn and masa are top notch, so I'm inclined to think that if wood were vastly superior in some way, the guy from Masienda would be using one. After all, he access to a Molinito and any of the heirloom corn he wants, so unless he's using it in his videos simply to sell it and make money, it must be pretty good.",Masienda Tortilla Press vs. wooden one,mexicanfood

industriald85,"Hello lovely people,

Tl;dr - _we are looking for a great salsa verde (?) recipe_

My partner and I were ordering dinner from our favourite local Mexican Restaurant on Ubereats, and we got talking about a restaurant that we visited weekly until it unfortunately closed.

They had a delicious salsa verde (we think that‚Äôs what it was) that would come out as an entree/starter.

They had a green salsa and a red one.  The green one was heavenly, and I would be ecstatic if I was able to replicate it.

It‚Äôs hard to describe what it tasted like, it was fairly thin, and a spoonful of it tasted something like a beautiful Italian salad condensed into a teaspoon.

If anyone has a recipe, or knows that it may be something else, I would be very appreciative.

Anonymiss313,"Hi all, my fiance comes from a big Mexican family and every year for thanksgiving his dad would make red chile with pork to act as a sort of gravy and to go along with all the traditional American foods he made as well. His dad was supposed to teach me how to make red chile this year, but he passed away very suddenly in October and never got the chance. I asked a few friends and people in my neighborhood if anyone had a recipe for red chile so I could make some for my fiance, and someone shared their grandma's recipe which is super simple:

5 dried chile guajillos, 4 dried chile puyo, 2 dried chile pasillo ancho, 1/4 white onion, 2 tbsp minced garlic, 2 tbsp beef boullion, and 2 tbsp salt. They say to blend the peppers in 2 cups of hot water, cube the pork, brown the pork, and then simmer in the sauce for 20 minutes.

My fiance said something similar but said that some of his family just buy a bag of ""red chile peppers"" and use those, rather than using different types of peppers (nobody knows what his dad did, though). Additionally, his dad would sometimes sear the meat and then cook it in the sauce in a slow cooker for the rest of the day, so I have no clue whether I should just brown it or if I should put it in the slow cooker as some people do it differently. Also, if I do go based off of the recipe and use the different types of peppers, how spicey or not might this recipe turn out? His dads always turned out very flavorful and savory but not really spicey by any means.

Thank you so much for any insight you can offer.

today, I went to a local Mexican restaurant called Taqueria el Manhattan. That might sound like something having your alarm bells going off saying, Texmex, not authentic! Sorry! I am here to tell you however, if you bring up their menu online, this is the location in Fort Mill SC. you would not believe their menu! Probably the most authentic place I have ever been, and that's saying something.

I decided to be very brave. Yes. I do know what is in this dish, so don't worry about thinking ""If he only knew what he just ate. "" i'm pretty much aware. anyway, my brother and I both for the very first time ever got to try very authentically mend Menudo. The way they prepared it was with the red colored broth. The lady who served us is from Ecuador. She said that they are, the way they make it is with a white colored broth. The way we had it today included onions, cilantro, jalape√±os, although I left those out, and I think it also had potatoes. I get confused of the one other main ingredient which unfortunately grosses a lot of people out. Is it cal stomach‚Ä¶ aka tribe? I was under the impression that it was actually Cal intestines. can somebody up here familiar with the dish please clarify?

my brother and I have both been blind since birth, therefore, visually, we were unable to see exactly what this was, and only could go by feel and taste, however, there was something down deep inside the bowl which was very very hard as a rock. Some sort of a bone. Definitely not something you would like to try biting into. He would break your teeth did so. it had meat around the bone however. It kind of reminded me of the way a prime rib would look. I don't know if that was intestines? Or what that was exactly. either way though, the meat was absolutely delicious!

i'm curious if anyone else up here has ever had this soup before, and if so, what you all thought of it.

Neurohacker2555,"I have searched endlessly for this recipe online and have had no luck finding it. 

At some Mexican restaurants they have chicken tacos made with shredded chicken. The chicken looks slow cooked and contains onions and dark green peppers (not sure if they are bell peppers or not but my guess would be that they are a different kind). The onions and peppers are clearly visible (maybe 1 inch long). The chicken has a slight orange/red tint, possibly from tomatoes but it could be from something else. It is also extremely wet and always drips out of the taco when eating it and leaves the tortilla soggy. The taste doesn't suggest that it has a lot of the traditional Mexican spices (cumin, etc.) but it might contain some. 

I kind of wonder if it's a pre-made mixture the restaurants are buying, perhaps in a can or frozen. If so, I'd love to know the brand or where I can buy it.

smemmy,"i'm not super knowledgeable about mexican food, all we have where i live are burrito places that all seem to serve the exact same things, down to identical ingredients, with slight variations. rancheritos comes to mind as an example, but there are other places that aren't rancheritos but are very similar in what they offer. it seems to me though that what would be considered tex mex, is more like del taco or taco bell. to a slightly lesser extent costa vida, cafe rio and chipotle. i've never seen an item at taco bell with adobada or lengua for example, and i feel like the day they have menudo on their menu is the day when i see pigs fly.   


these places definitely aren't gourmet, they are 100% fast food, but just like the food of any country/culture, there are going to be varying degrees of quality. just because it's on the lower end doesn't make it any less ""real"", or at least i feel like i shouldn't write it off for that reason alone. i always see almost exclusively hispanic people running these places, and a good amount of the customers are also hispanic. i like a lot of the food from these places as much as any other fast food but i've always had it in the back of my mind that it's probably a very americanized version of mexican food that is far removed from what actual mexican people, who live in mexico, eat on a regular basis.   


basically i'm wondering if the food you find at these burrito places are representative of what people eat in mexico, or if it's like the chinese food you find at a chinese buffet in america where it has been drastically altered and engineered to appeal to an american pallet, from what people actually eat in it's country of origin.","how do i tell the difference between a ""real"" mexican restaurant and a tex mex restaurant?",mexicanfood

I've been wanting to make cochinita pibil for awhile but I'm running into an issue with cooking method. From what I understand it is traditional to wrap the pork in banana leaves so it doesn't dry out. However, I don't have a source for banana leaves. I've seen recipes that say to simply wrap the pork in foil, but I am hesitant to cook an acidic food directly in foil for a long period of time.

My question is: can I oven cook cochinita pibil by simply putting it in a casserole dish and covering (not wrapping) it with foil? This is how I cook carnitas and they come out juicy (3.5 hours at 275 degrees- I don't add lard, just a little olive oil and the fat from the pork works fine to render it). If it's the same cut of meat (pork shoulder), I'm not sure why it's necessary to wrap the meat directly. Am I missing something crucial?

Any advice would be appreciated.",How to cook cochinita pibil?,mexicanfood

I‚Äôm an Italian who only knows how to make Italian food unfortunately and proficiently seasons and dabbles with Chinese and Thai food somehow lol. 

My boyfriend of 10 years (needless to say we are pretty candid and blunt with one another) is Mexican and Peruvian. He is also a picky eater &amp; severely lactose intolerant which pretty much ruins most Italian dishes because I‚Äôm usually just in it for the cheese lol. 

We are always in a hurry so we really rely on quick meals, a rice cooker, &amp; a crockpot. 

I make the worst ‚ÄúMexican‚Äù food pretty much in the world. Mexican and Peruvian food is pretty much all he likes to make matters worse. 
Most of our meals are simple and just consist of seasoned meat and white rice. 
Every time I try to add what I think is some sort of Mexican or peruvian ‚Äúflare‚Äù it pretty much comes out horrible and he hates it, anddddddd so do I but I‚Äôll never admit it to him I just keep telling him he‚Äôs pickyü§£

Most recipes on the internet are usually for a full complete dish which we usually don‚Äôt do- just some seasoned meat and bland rice. My seasoning is so bad at this point if it‚Äôs not Italian, where he pleads me to just do salt and pepper on everything only. Which makes me sad and my taste buds sad. 

I‚Äôm going to be the mom where everyone was giving my dinner to the dog which also makes me sad because I thought I was a great cook. 

I guess what I‚Äôm getting at are, what are (if there is any) just some standard spice combinations?

I know my boyfriend misses that and how she cooks, which she doesn‚Äôt do anymore and I‚Äôm unable to even come close to getting anything she used to make right or even anything Mexican or peruvian tasting at all.

AnatoliaFarStar,"I was hoping my first post on this sub would be to proudly share one of my creations in my new molcajete... but sadly it's almost the opposite.

I bought my ""Aztec blender"" a few weeks ago, and have spent the last couple weeks grinding rice and rinsing at least once a day. I got to the point where I couldn't see any more bits of grit in the ground rice mix, and happily set to making salsa and guacamole with pretty decent results.

Today I'm making guacamole and maybe I was rougher than before, but it's full of tiny little dots of grit again! So I have two questions, if you'll indulge me.

1. If the grit simply never goes away, am I looking at an inferior product? I've done a lot of reading, but some people seem to say it's normal, while others say it's a sign of poor quality.

2. If I continue to get the odd fleck of grit in my guac or salsa once in a while, is it a problem for my teeth? I mean, I'd rather not feed my wife bits of rock, but I'm OK with eating stuff with the occasional speck, as long as it's not actually slowly grinding my teeth down...

(Yes, I should keep trying to season the thing, but honestly I got to the point where I couldn't see any evidence of grit. So if I started again, I wouldn't know when to stop...)

Duffuser,"I've always considered making this classic dish, but the ingredient list is a little daunting, and of course sour oranges are hard to come by outside the Yucatan, let alone where I am in the Midwest US. However now that I'm a little more experienced with Mexican cooking, I recognize that most of those super complicated recipes only have a ton of ingredients because they're essentially having you make achiote paste from scratch, and the Mexican markets in my area have enough variety of ingredients now that I can easily get achiote paste, bottled Goya sour orange juice, and frozen banana leaves.

My biggest question is about the orange juice. I know for other citrus like lime and lemon the bottled version is a pale imitation of fresh juice, so would I be better off using fresh sweet orange juice and a substitute souring agent like lime juice or vinegar instead of the bottled sour orange juice?

Also I was curious about using a pressure cooker. Obviously the traditional way is to have a whole suckling pig wrapped in leaves and buried in a piib, but most recipes have you wrap pork shoulder or leg in the leaves and slow roast to steam the meat. I've had great luck in the past with slow braised dishes in the pressure cooker, and since it's a sealed you don't lose much of the juices and drippings, which I understand to be a pretty major flavor component of the finished meat. Could I just wrap the marinated pork in banana leaves then cook it under pressure?

Obviously this would be even better if I made everything from scratch and had all the right ingredients, but can I make a decent shortcut version with these readily available ingredients?","Can I make a passable cochinita pibil with just achiote paste, bottled naranja agria, and frozen banana leaves?",mexicanfood

SKiP13,"Hello! 

I have been searching/scouring the internet for years to find a dupe of my favorite restaurant salsa ever. I have tried ""restaurant"" style salsa recipes and they are good but don't look like or taste like the one I am hunting. The restaurant that made it went out of business years ago. (I even asked the owner if he would tell me the recipe but alas he would not.)

The restaurant was Gina's in Bryan, Texas. But I have been to other Mexican and Tex-Mex places that had a similar salsa.

I am currently in Scotland on lockdown and there is no Mexican food happening in my life save for what I can make myself. 

I have tried every combination of keywords I can think of to find the right recipe but have had zero success. So I come to you, begging for your assistance.

Here's what I can tell you:

1) It was a very thin, almost watery, transparent/translucent salsa that they brought to the table in squeeze bottles and syrup bottles (the kind with the little slider on top) so you could fill up the salsa bowl yourself or pour over your food. 2) It was not bright red. It was more pale red-pale orange in color. 3) Zero chunks of anything. The most texture you could discern were some seeds (tomato? peppers? idk) and some slivers of skin (tomatoes? peppers? idk). 4) I don't believe it was roasted because there were no blackened pieces in it. But I don't *think* it was a raw salsa. It might have been cooked but I don't remember it having a sheen like oil was in it. But I just don't know. 5) It varied in heat from one visit to the next. Maybe jalapeno to serrano on the Scoville scale? 6) They served it cold. 7) It did not taste of cumin. 8) It did not have cilantro in it.

The closest I have come to it is a salsa roja that mentioned the squeeze bottles in their description and looks sort of similar but is chunkier and thicker than what I am hunting.

I have cross-posted over at SalsaSnobs and so far I can rule out a chile Arbol orange sauce (way too thick and is bright orange), salsa macha, and sriracha. 

One person said that they had an uncle who had worked at a restaurant in Texas and that they had a thin translucent salsa and it may have been made with tomatillos and chicken stock as part of the ingredients. 

Does this ring any bells with anyone? 

I would be so grateful if anyone has any ideas.

Many thanks.

The process worked, but was a) a pain in the ass and b) the goal of  making my own masa was to get away from Maseca and use really good corn (Masienda). 

So, my question is: outside of putting in a lot of muscle to grind it with a matete or spending a small fortune getting a Nixtamatic to the States (plus, I don't have that kind of kitchen space. Is small), what can I use to make masa at home? Do I just need to save up and get a Nixtamatic?",Turning Nixtamal into Masa,mexicanfood
DCT1997,"This week at my cafe, we are doing Tacos. My manager was showing me today how to deep fry tortilla chips. I asked him how long do you deep fry them for, and he didn't really give me an answer. He just said shake the fryer basket and you can kind of tell how crispy they are.

So I started frying them, and I guess I cooked them a bit too long. The manager said I overcooked them a little bit and they tasted kind of burnt.

And also he said I was taking too long to cook them up. The deep fryer is in the main cafeteria downstairs where I work at. He came down after a while and said, ""I was wondering where you went, you are taking a while.""

There were a lot of tortillas to fry. My manager showed me how to fry in one basket. I figured I should just do one at a time. However, to speed it up, I should've done probably two at a time.

I feel discouraged because I messed up and I don't want my manager to be disappointed in me. He has been so impressed with my performance so far.

--Rob,"Summary: I need help learning the name of a Hispanic pastry. I apologize in advance if this would be better located somewhere else. 

Body:
There was a Mexican bakery that had a long, rounded-rectangle baked good. The best way I can describe it is fluffy and soft, medium-density, and a whipped cream filling. The flavor of the dough is reminiscent of a King‚Äôs Hawaiin bread, although slightly less sweet. 

For contrast, a lot of cream horns are similar. However, those tend to be crunchy or hard on the outside (this was not), and their cream tends to lean more like ‚Äúpudding‚Äù (this was not).

dayshinesun,"I live in Los Angeles where we are known for having some of the best Mexican food in the United States. But, the sad truth is that very few Mexican restaurants can compare to what you experience in Mexico or your native mother's home cooking.

Even in Mexico, some of the big tourist areas have begun to conform to the tourist palate by cooking things the TexMex way. 

You can taste the difference in quality: mass produced tortillas versus handmade, canned beans versus home cooked beans, mexican rice with tomato paste instead of making the tomato sauce from scratch, salsas with no heat and fistfuls of cumin. Americans love to put cumin in everything thinking it makes it more Mexican because they don't know about epazote, achiote, and oregano. Don't even get me started on the mountains of cheddar cheese and sour cream!

I think it's great to have an appreciation for the food and the culture, but there also has to be some respect for it's traditional roots. There are Mexican dishes from the prehispanic era that are a thousand years old, and the Viceroyalty and 19th century where we see European influences from Spain and France. These traditional dishes are NOT the American plates people call TexMex.

There's a history of mestizaje in the food and a history of our indigenous roots that deserves to be BOLD and unapologetic to the foreign palate. Some people won't like the sourness of lime used in ceviche or aguachiles, or the spicy drenching heat from tortas ahogadas, or the sweet nutty earthiness of mole poblano, or the fat butteriness of menudo. That's okay! Don't change the dish to please foreign taste and call it Mexican. 

If you live in America or you make food for American tourists at resorts that is not authentic, just call it American food. 

Mexican food needs to stay vibrant and intense, and your taco bell menu doesn't deserve to be called Mexican food.

Carma asada is great but grilling out door is tough in the winter. I know you can grill in the oven but I was curious to hear your preferred method 

I use to put meat on baking sheet and cook on broil but that method creates a mess and the oven will eventually cook the juice and leave a smoky mess in your house. 

Instead, I now  put meat on top of BBQ grill and then put grill over one of those turkey aluminum tins. This helps separate juice from meat. I then set oven to broil and cook for 5 minutes.

vinethatatethesouth,"Per the title, I‚Äôm looking for how ground beef is seasoned and cooked for Americanized tacos served in Mexican restaurants.  

The typical American taco with ground beef (and by typical I mean the average white family cooking ground beef for taco night) is prepared as such: ground beef browned in a pan, fat drained out, a seasoning packet dumped on top and mixed in, and then water added and reduced until ready to serve.  

What this typically yields is a greasy mess that is strong on the cumin and salt. The ground beef is usually broken up only so much in the pan so the pieces are larger. If this meat sits at room temperature it usually congeals to beef covered in orange gel.  

In contrast, whenever I‚Äôve ordered a ground beef taco at Mexican restaurants, the beef is finely ground and well-seasoned, and always better than what my family made growing up.

CMDRAlcubierre,"Hi there lovers of Mexican food and culture!

Some of us in the United States can be considered the lucky ones. Depending on where you live you get access to a wide variety of taquerias with fantastic recipes, long legacies, and great quality control.

Other areas? Not always so much. I've been lucky to have spent most of my life in West Coast states where this is largely true, but the further North you go, the spottier things seem to get.

I imagine it's a function of supply and distribution, how only a couple hundred miles can change a lot.

But one observation I've made over time is that, with the exception of Southern California, the price of food at places which grill their chicken is higher than places which shred their chicken. 

I've seen fewer exceptions to this rule the further North I go.

Generally the grilled chicken is deliciously tender, never dry, well- seasoned with even a nice char that goes great with any smoky hot sauce. It is missing noticeable connective tissue and fat, and the impression I get is that the meat was probably expensive.

Contrasting this with shredded chicken, and often it seems there is...well...less flavor in shredded chicken. Depending on how it was cooked, the sauce is either quite mild, with a noticeably plain base chicken taste, or the sauce is very flavorful, but the chicken meat itself doesn't present flavor wise.

I suspect, and anyone who knows better than me can confirm, is it easier to hide ""cheap"" chicken by shredding it and slow cooking? 

I'm using inductive reasoning here, because at the same restaurants which shred their chicken, I'm far more likely to get a gristly Asada. Places which grill their chicken tend to also have tender, not gristly Asada.

So by now, when I see shredded chicken on the menu, I tend to suspect how much the meat actually cost.

I'm almost certain this isn't always true, and suspect also it may not be widely true, but for those in the know, why would a chef decide to use a grilled chicken vs. a shredded chicken recipe? Is it regional where the former is preferred to the latter? Or is it indeed a way to make cheaper chicken taste more appetizing?

Perhaps some of both?  Does anybody have a compelling story of why they prefer shredded chicken to a tender grilled chicken?

I am moving across state soon and would like to learn how to make it myself, however my shyness combined with language barrier I have not asked her how.
BUT! I have learned some things from watching her and i‚Äôm wondering if anyone can help me recreate this salsa from pure memory and watching her!:(

she usually blends or uses a molcajete 
she first puts a little water and salt as a base
she roasts tomatoes and Serrano peppers in a pan until they have black spots
THEN ! here is where i get lost... 
does she blend it all together? and add other things? I don‚Äôt know. usually the consistency is very watery and thin and i like it!! I like it very spicy too :( Im hoping someone else kinda makes it like this and can give me all the steps.. thank you!

knorben,"I just made this recipe tonight but used pork neck and butt in place of the ribs. It was fantastic. However, it was a bit weird to boil the pork and then stew it. So, a couple of questions - 1) is there another cooking process I could use to get the same results and 2) what are some variations for this from different areas of Mexico outside of Puebla.

Recipe:

Serves 6-8
Ingredients
4 oz. tomatillos, husked and rinsed
2 jalape√±os, stemmed
2 cups lightly packed cilantro leaves
1 tsp. sugar
4 whole cloves garlic, peeled, plus 6 cloves, roughly chopped
2 lb. baby back pork ribs, cut into individual ribs
1 tsp. dried oregano
1 large white onion, cut lengthwise into 8 wedges
1 medium zucchini, cut into 2"" x 12"" batons
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
Warm tortillas, for serving

Instructions

Place tomatillos and jalape√±os in a 4-qt. saucepan, and cover with water by 1"". Bring to a boil over high heat; cook until slightly soft, about 5 minutes. Drain vegetables, and set aside to cool to room temperature. Place in a food processor along with cilantro, sugar, and whole garlic, and pulse until finely chopped but not pur√©ed; set sauce aside.

Bring pork and 4 cups water to a boil in a 6-qt. saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until all water evaporates, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Continue cooking pork, stirring often, until it begins to caramelize on the outside, about 10 minutes. Add chopped garlic, oregano, and onion, and cook, stirring, until soft and lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Add sauce, and fry, stirring constantly, until slightly reduced, about 5 minutes. Add 4 cups water, bring to a boil, and then reduce heat to medium-low; cook, stirring occasionally, until pork is tender and sauce is thickened, about 30 minutes. Add zucchini, and cook until warmed through, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

ReggieMX,"**Taco bell is ""Mexican food""** - Taco Bell is to Mexican food what Benihana is to Japanese food or McDonald's is to German food. Surely a lot of people in the southern US states knows the difference, but most US people (including a lot  of people with Mexican roots) do consider Taco bell ""Mexican"".

**You can create Mexican food outside of Mexico** - To put it simply, you simply can't. You can however create fussion dishes based on traditional Mexican recipes (and call those whatever you like, like dim sum tacos or Minessota tamales) but everything you create outside the country is something else but Mexican. Most Mexicans in actual Mexico agree on this. 

**Cheddar Cheese is used in Mexican Food** - It's not. The Yucatan peninsula is certainly fond of Yellow Dutch Cheese and use it in several dishes, but you never use cheddar in Mexican recipes, ever. 

**All Mexican food has 'chile' on it** - Plenty of dishes can be eaten and prepared without chiles and even when most Mexicans like some spicy capsaiscin, it's not mandatory, plenty of Mexicans eat no chile at all.

**Doritos were invented in Disneyland** - Technically they were not, despite what stories that company's marketing team created to appeal US chauvinism, flavored tortilla chips have been in any Mexican Kitchen for thousands of years. Pretending that frito lay created something (instead of just adding a particular flavor) is like saying that Pizza was invented in Chicago by some cook that had tomato sauce and cheese around.

natethegreatt1,"I've made blue corn tortillas a few times and I've done more than my fair share of research to try to figure the stuff out.



Here's what I know, empirically and from research:



- Blue corn has more protein than the typical yellow/white varieties we use in the states
- Because it has more protein (I think this is the reason), it is a little more difficult to work with than yellow/white corn flours.
- Because of this, I've found the most success using a little bit of AP flour in the recipe (blue corn maseca + ap flour + baking soda +hot water)
- I've seen a few recipes that don't use AP flour, but they do add a little bit of fat (oil/lard). I'm assuming they do this because, like adding fat to flour tortillas, the blue corn's high protein means it needs the help of fat to come together better as a dough.



Can anyone comment on any of this? I'd like to make blue corn tortillas without the addition of a wheat flour - I'm going to make them tonight with no wheat flour, but with some fat.

It's a masa dough, filled w/ orange mashed potatoes and some queso oaxaca. Then they are deep fried. The potatoes are nice and soft and homogeneous and are pretty damn orange. Then there is the layer of melted queso oaxaca. It's sublime - they serve it over a black bean puree and top it w/ avocado tomatillo salsa, crema and queso fresco.


Anyway, I digress. All I can really tell is that they use at least a little bit of butter in the mashed potatoes. Because they don't taste strongly like paprika or cumin, I'm thinking they are simply colored with achiote. They aren't spicy, but they have a TINY kick to them.

Now, I'm in Chicago, and there are tons of taquerias around. But, the tacos are all topped with lettuce, tomato, cheese, and sour cream. Even when they're just onions and cilantro, you don't get any of the grilled onions, peppers, or escabeche.

brereddit,"I was in Lubbock, TX this week on emergency travel. Since I grew up in New Mexico, my visit turned into a quest for great Mexican food. (east coaster) I'm going to not name the restaurants that weren't up to par, but I'm going to share two stories (one good and one bad) and then use that as a pretext to ask a culinary question of you my fellow Mexicans.  

First, the bad news. My family went out to this restaurant and my bro and I ordered Carnitas. They come out pretty quickly and they looked promising--clearly roasted, plenty of marbling and I'm excited. Then I take the first bite and it is warm but chewy. As I chew, my eyebrows start to go up.  As an optimist, I filter out negative feelings routinely and tell myself to grab a tortilla, some green sauce and try again, maybe with some refried beans mixed in. All of that tasted ok except for the carnitas. My brother asks me what I thought of the Carnitas and I think I summarized it  as succinctly as possible:  ""I think we're eating leftovers.""  Dude. I'm serious, it tasted like they made the carnitas the day before, stored them in the fridge and then threw them into the oven before serving them. Dried, chewy and that chemically taste that you only get the second day after you try to eat meat.   You know what I'm talking about.  Meat undergoes some sort of transformation when it is refrigerated and heated up again.  As we all know, the only use for used meat is soup. You can't double cook any meat. Ok, I  admit, yes, fried rice can also be a venue for day old meat.  But dude, you don't cook carnitas, refrigerate them and then serve them again, in a restaurant!  ¬°h√≠jole!  

Some of you are wondering what I did in response. Did I send it back?  Nope. I have a rule against that since it is pretty rude and even if someone disrespects me enough to serve old Carnitas, I do not get dragged down.  In this case, I just ate what was decent and had an extra beer or two--the chips were decent. However, in other cases, I have resorted to ordering a second entre. This usually results in the wait staff asking if everything is ok.  Yes, I say, no problem, I'm just going to sample something else.  (sometimes they take it off the check but I would never ask...never).  

Now the good news. I often search out great breakfast burritos and was told to try Burrito Tower.  I'm not affiliated with them in any way.  This place knocked it out of the park. First, it is a total hole in the wall. It is literally a former gas station. The inside has only 4 tables.  I told my brothers they should have called it Burrito Station or Burrito Service Station. They laughed a little and I said, ""Exxon Burrito"" and yes, that joke brought real laughter ...deservedly so. 

Anyway, the food was spectacular.  First, the tortillas were really fresh and that's the first thing you taste so I just don't understand anyone anywhere trying to sell Mexican food without thinking long and hard about how to offer a tasty tortilla (corn or flour).  The eggs, sausage, cheese and potatoes were awesome. They had lots of other combinations including beans, chiles, etc. The potatoes were perfect. They werent overcooked but were soft and buttered. Friggin amazing.  We ended up eating there every day.   We being my family. 

One day, there was a lot of errand running around and I snuck back over to Burrito Tower for lunch because I haven't had a good beef/bean burrito since I was a kid.  I didn't tell any of my family because we all knew having been eating there every morning was starting to attract attention. So I stealthily showed up again at the drive through window.  I was not disappointed. In fact, I couldn't believe how good the ground beef was in the burrito.  I later revealed my secret mission to my family and got some laughs because, yeah, I'm a freak. 

That brings me to my question. How the heck did they get the beef to taste so good?  Before you mention Cumin, let me say that I'm not a fan of it. Or at least, let me say that Chipotle is very over reliant on this spice.    What I'm wondering is if maybe people cook ground beef in bacon grease or something. Anyway, I'm looking for any tips you have to make really good beef for a burrito.

I'm slowly trying to introduce Mexican products in my country, but I can always learn more recipes and use more ideas instead of reinventing hot water... that way I'll hopefully teach people how to use mexican products in real mexican dishes at home.",books,mexicanfood
bears2013,"I *love* Mexican food, but I'm going to be spending the next year of my life in a frigid Asian country. I've never been to a Mexican supermarket before (there are a ton here in CA), but I'm hoping to bring some dry good with me to make when I'm abroad. e.g., polenta, masa harina for tortillas, etc.
  
 
  
What products and/or brands would you recommend? I'm mostly looking for non-refrigerated foods (canned, dry, etc), but any other suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks!",'Holy grail' items at your typical Mexican market?,mexicanfood
